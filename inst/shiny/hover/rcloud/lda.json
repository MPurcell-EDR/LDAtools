A: Well, I think they've always _ always been advised to be careful of travel, but I'm not prepared to say nobody should travel to any place in the Middle East. I'm not prepared to say that at all. Q: What about outside the Middle East? A: I'd be careful wherever you go, these days. Q: Speaking of trips, did you have any concern about your own trip to Kennebunkport, that you'll be able to stay on top of things while you're up here _ A: I think we're going to have a safe trip. Are you referring to the safety of the trip? Q: (Off mike.) A: No, I can easily stay here. We have a highly complex and highly efficient communications. I have some of my top advisers here. Others will be coming up there from time to time. I expect to see Jim Baker up there very soon. And I'm in very close _ I will be in very close touch with Pentagon officials or whoever's behind National Security Council right now, it'll be General Scowcroft. So I'm determined to _ that life goes on. I will have a busy schedule _ busier than I'd like to have had _ of contacts. In fact, I've got a list of calls that I'll be making over the next couple of days _ not all to the Middle East, incidentally. And so it'll be a little different than I'd hoped but I think I'm doing the right thing. I think the American people want to see life go on so long as they understand that their President and his top officials are on top of a troubled situation. So, that's the way I looked at it. And if I find it gets _ matters seem to be _ require my going back, it's an hour and a half to go back. So, I think we're in pretty good shape on that. Q: (Off mike.) A: Yeah. I mean, you've seen the telephone in my golf cart, or boat. Word of honor, well, I talked, you know _ where was it? We talked to _ where was it when we were out in the Fidelity last time? STAFF: (Off mike.) A: No, no. No, no, well, that was one, yeah, that was one. But, no, the other day we were out in _ and talked overseas, I believe it was, but in any event, I think it's _ I should reassure the American people that the communication is extraordinarily good. And if I found that I needed meetings with these top officials or with foreign officials and it would be more convenient to do it in Washington, it's very easy to go back. Q: Any concern _ (inaudible) _ Mr. President? A: No. I think the American people will support what I'm _ you mean on this? Q: You're going _ you're on a vacation at the same time as _ A: No, not at all. Q: Thank you. A: When I'm going to be working _ normally, you know, what I've said is, ``Look, if I'm on vacation, I want to have a vacation, and I don't want to try to kid the American people that I'm working _ play and play hard and then work like hell the rest of the time when you're in Washington.'' And I think I've done that. Go to work early in the morning, go home late at night. This one will be different because there are some tasks that I must undertake up here, but _ so, it'll be a little _ it'll be legitimately a combination of work and play, but I don't want to deceive the American people. Just tell them what you think and ask for their support. And I think people will understand that. So, that's the way _ that's the way I approach this. You know, what you don't want to do is appear to be held hostage in the White House to events. And I'm not going to do that. That's why we have all this sophisticated intelligence. So, I feel all right about it.", " Cupid has a new message for lovers this Valentine's Day and volunteers are lining up to spread the word from Loveland. People around the world send their Valentines through the Loveland post office each year to get the special postmark and cachet verse. Ted Thompson, 85, has been coming up with verses since he and his wife, Mabel, started the remailing program in 1947. An estimated 300,000 people will get Thompson's latest Valentine's verse: ``It might just be a song bird, ``Or perhaps some sparkling dew, ``That brings fond recollections, ``And a timeless cupid too.'' Thompson said recently he's not sure where he got the inspiration. ``It takes the whole year for me to get something I'm satisfied with. It's a hard thing for me. Some people are born to write a verse for you, but that's far away from me.'' Since it stamped 300 pieces of mail its first year, more than 7 million Valentines have passed through the program. The mail is hand-stamped by about 50 senior-citizen volunteers. There's no charge for the extra touch, which begins Monday and continues through Feb. 14.", " Richard Sagness has a double-dipped career _ during the school year he's a college professor but during the summer he's a scooper. That's why they call him Dr. Ice Cream. ``It's a real tough way to spend the summer,'' Sagness chuckled as he leaned over his ice cream cart at downtown Pocatello's Simplot Square. ``I suppose some people think it's beneath my dignity to be doing this, but I think that's nonsense.'' Sagness, who trains the teachers of tomorrow as a professor in Idaho State University's College of Education, says he's not in it for the money. He does it, he says, to help his wife keep her cool. ``He's doing this very willingly,'' maintained Donna Sagness, who owns the local ice cream shop. But she conceded the cart has been a good way to keep her husband out of trouble. ``He's worth what I pay him, which is nothing,'' she said. ``He's good with the cart, but we have to watch him when he's in the store. He'll eat everything, including the flavors that nobody else will eat, like brandied fruitcake.'' Sagness admits his love of ice cream, especially when it's free, keeps him on the job. ``When I was a kid, I worked at a soda fountain. The owner said, `Eat all you want, because eventually you'll get tired of it,''' he recalled. ``I was his only employee that never got tired of it.''", " The signs say ``Always Open,'' but for the first time in 35 years, most of the 1,200 Denny's restaurants across the United States will close their doors for Christmas Day. Locking those doors is a different story. Some buildings have been without locks for decades because of the always-open policy. At others, the locks have never been used and the keys can't be found. The company is having to install locks at about 700 restaurants, said Joe Herrera, director of marketing at the company's southern California headquarters. The company decided to close this year so employees could have the day off. ``It will cost us about $5 million in sales,'' Herrera said. The chain's 60,000 employees were so grateful for the holiday that many sent cards and letters of appreciation to the offices, Herrera said. Employees received normal pay for Christmas Day. ``We just feel we spend 364 days a year taking care of other people's families; for one day a year we want to take care of our own,'' he said. Nobody wants to work on Christmas, he said, and it has been the top turnover day of the year, with some managers losing four or five employees. In Hollywood, the companywide closing solved manager Almaz Legesse's problem of choosing which employees of a Sunset Boulevard restaurant to give the day off. ``I had a big list. ... I was having a hard time,'' she said. The restaurant, which serves more than 1,700 Christmas customers, was awaiting a visit from a locksmith. ``We never had locks,'' Ms. Legesse said. ``After so many years of working Christmas every year it's real nice,'' said Lee Sevene, a manager at a Denny's near a turnpike in Portland, Me. ``People have always thanked us a lot for staying open,'' said Frances Bushman, manager of a Pismo Beach, Calif., Denny's. ``On the other hand they always felt sorry for our waitresses and cooks,'' she said. Ms. Bushman's Denny's has locks but she had to check to see if the keys fit. Christmases in the past have been about twice as busy as average days at Denny's, Herrera said. ``We have up to an hour wait sometimes on Christmas, and that's all day _ not just at midday,'' Herrera said. ``It actually starts on Christmas Eve, and just keeps going.'' The Christmas closing applied to 1,221 restaurants. The operators of 174 franchise restaurants were allowed to make their own decisions. Winifred Gibson, a manager at two Denny's franchise restaurants in Fresno, Calif., said they would remain open for the biggest day of the year. But she sympathized with the trouble of locking up a Denny's. ``Once I needed to lock the doors on my store. It was a major fiasco. It took us a day to find the keys,'' Ms. Gibson said. Christmas Day used to bring in mostly single people, couples with no children or elderly people with no family, she said. ``But not anymore. You have so many one-parent families.'' The three franchise Denny's in Anchorage, Alaska, and one in Fairbanks will be open, said Donna Flanagan, manager of an Anchorage restaurant. Ms. Flanagan expects to serve about 1,500 people on Christmas, which is second only to Mother's Day in bringing in customers.", " A chain saw is useful for cleanup and maintenance of your yard and garden, but observe some basics for safe and easy operation. Solo Incorporated, which makes chain saws, has these tips: _ When starting the chain saw, place it on level ground at least 10 feet from the gas can and fueling area. Hold the saw down by placing one foot on the rear handlebar while firmly holding the front handlebar with one hand. If your saw has only a top handlebar, hold it firmly on the ground, pulling up on the starting grip. _ Hold the saw firmly with both hands, maintaining a secure grip. This will help you avoid injury from kickback. Don't overreach or cut above shoulder height, and when cutting logs, only cut one at a time. _ In bucking timber, don't stand directly behind the saw while cutting. Position yourself so you'll be away from the direction of the log roll. Hold the saw on the right side of your body (outside the line of sight across the chain) to minimize chances of injury from an unexpected broken chain or kickback. Examine the log for internal stress _ a bowed appearance is an indication _ and avoid cutting the log on the wrong side, which can result in kickback. _ To avoid kickback while limbing, make sure the log is in a secure position and work on the safest side _ usually uphill and away from the fall of cut limbs. To avoid kickback, make sure the guidebar's tip doesn't come in contact with another branch, the side of a tree, or another object. When limbing, bend your knees slightly and position your right leg behind the front carrying handlebar. The left leg should be forward and away from the guidebar's contact range. Avoid standing on limbs, slash or debris. _ Survey the area before felling a tree. Is the trunk sound or hollow and rotted? What's the wind direction and speed? Which direction is the tree leaning in? Is the tree's crown denser and heavier on one side? When you've determined the answers to these questions, figure your escape route, which should be at a 45-degee angle back from the line of the fall. When you have checked this and cleared the small limbs and branches from the bottom portion of the trunk, you're ready to fell the tree. Stand away from the tree and maintain a balanced stance. Then start by making a careful undercut. This notch, cut to a depth of a quarter-inch, will determine the line of the fall and should be positioned at a right angle to the projected fall. _ Wear protective clothing each time you use a saw. These include goggles or a face mask, snug but comfortable work clothing, cuffless long pants, hearing protection, non-slip safety gloves, and boots with steel toecaps.", " The certified world's champion credit-card collector _ he never leaves home without a bunch of them _ says he wants to get even more of the handy little plastics. Walter Cavanagh, ``Mr. Fantastic Plastic'' as he calls himself, says he is determined to get one of each of the 10,000 credit cards he estimates are available in this country. He figures it will take him five years to reach his goal. ``I figure I only have 12 percent of what's out there,'' he said in an interview last week. ``My goal is to get them all.'' Cavanagh, whose 1,099 credit cars earned him a paragraph in the Guinness Book of World Records, said he applies for 100 cards a month, and gets few refusals. `I did get a letter from a gas company back East asking why I wanted a card since I lived 3,000 miles from one of their stations,'' Cavanagh said. He doesn't owe on any of the cards because he pays his bills in full.

A blunt one, asked in a different kind of ``Peanuts'' special that CBS is showing Friday night. Rest assured, though, that the ending is upbeat, in keeping with medical fact and the nature of Charles M. Schulz. Schulz, who has drawn the wise and whimsical characters of his ``Peanuts'' cartoon strip since 1950 and did his first TV special in 1965, hadn't thought of making his next one about a child who develops leukemia. What became Friday's ``Why, Charlie Brown, Why?'' began, he says, with an idea from Sylvia Cook, a nurse in California who works with young cancer patients at Stanford Children's Hospital. She proposed a five-minute film for them in which cancer and its treatment were explained by the ``Peanuts'' gang. He recalls that he pointed out a few problems, including that animation is expensive. That didn't stop Cook, Schulz says. ``Gradually, her idea changed, and she finally decided that it'd be more important if we could do a film that would show the people around the person who was ill just what is going on,'' he says. Wth the aid of the American Cancer Society, that's ultimately what happened. It helped that Schulz came to believe the film would make a good ``Peanuts'' special for TV and shouldn't be limited to hospital showings. The gentle lessons of Friday's show include the early symptoms of leukemia and what can be expected in treatment of the disease. A key part of the program _ the survival rate of children stricken with leukemia _ is only obliquely noted, mainly because a mass of statistics would be as out of place in a ``Peanuts'' special as a visit from The Simpsons. Little Janice, in chemotherapy treatment that she notes will cause her temporary hair loss, quotes her doctors as saying she should get well. The survival rate for children is high, according to ACS spokesman David Lehmann. He says the society estimates 2,500 children will be stricken with leukemia this year, 1,900 of them with its acute form. However, thanks to advances in treatment, 71 percent are expected to survive, he says. Schulz, who worked with the society in preparing Friday's special, downplays his role in it. ``I didn't go into making this thing because I wanted to teach the world all about this,'' he says. ``This was the idea of the cancer people. It was their project. My only job was to make it palatable, to give it some kind of story and try to tell the things they wanted told, yet make it so that people wouldn't turn it off.'' Schulz, 67, who lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., about an hour's drive north of San Francisco, estimates Friday's is his 25th TV special since ``A Charlie Brown Christmas.'' He still draws the seven-day-a-week ``Peanuts'' strip that by CBS' estimate appears in more than 2,200 newspapers worldwide. He reckons he's drawn 15,000 of the strips since he began them 40 years ago. More than a few cartoonist have groused that the constant pressure of a daily strip at times has put them up against the wall, if not under it. No such gripes are heard from Schulz. ``No, quality is the only thing that worries me,'' he says. ``I don't worry about getting them done. I'm always worrying that I'll just end up doing the same things over and over. ``Just to try to keep the thing alive, and be trying new things, that's the hard part. Just getting it done is nothing. I think cartoonists who say it's hard to keep up the schedule are just lazy, that's all.''", " An enviornmental group on Thursday asked the European Economic Community to ban exports of toxic wastes to the Third World.

Representatives of President-elect Violeta Chamorro, declaring their intention to seek aid from Japan and Western Europe, said Monday the Soviet Union has agreed to continue the economic assistance it gave to the Sandinista regime of President Daniel Ortega. Pedro Chamorro, son of the newly elected Nicaraguan leader, told reporters at the State Department: ``The Soviets assure us that they are going to help Nicaragua; they are going to honor their commitments.'' Commenting after a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other ranking officials, Chamorro said that while Soviet arms are no longer needed or wanted, continued imports of Soviet oil are vital to Nicaragua's recovery. Chamorro and other political and economic advisers to Mrs. Chamorro plan further talks with government officials and with representatives of international lending institutions. Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said a package of recommendations will be sent to Bush within the next two weeks, spelling out what the United States can do to help. The U.S. economic embargo imposed against the Sandinista regime likely will be lifted before Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration as president on April 25, Aronson said. A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that to clear the way for U.S. aid to Nicaragua, Congress must agree to waive a law barring new assistance to a nation already in debt to the United States. He said there will be concerns about setting a precedent but added: ``I think there is a general recognition in both houses of Congress and in both parties that Nicaragua needs some immediate help.'' Chamorro and two other advisers to the new government _ Alfredo Cesar and Francisco Mayorga _ said no requests were made for a specific level of U.S. aid. Dollar figures will be discussed later, they said. Chamorro and Mayargo said the situation is complicated by the fact that the Sandinista government held economic data as a state secret. As a result, the full dimensions of Nicaragua's needs may not be known for some time, they said. Mayorga said, however, that ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' will be sought from all sources, including the United States. ``We expect the entire international community to contribute,'' he said. The Bush administration made clear that it also expects substantial help for Nicaragua from the international community, including Japan and Europe. ``The aid question is being worked on currently,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``We have optimism that the European allies, as well as the Soviet Union and Japan, are willing to help.'' Mrs. Chamorro's government _ which defeated Ortega and his leftists at the polls on Feb. 25 _ will replace the Sandinistas, whose overthrow the United States was unable to accomplish with military support for Contra rebels. Although the administration has pledged meaningful U.S. aid levels for Nicaragua, the final scope of the assistance package likely will be dictated by budget constraints and the needs of other fledgling democracies emerging in Eastern Europe. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid, told reporters: ``There is a long line forming outside the door on that score. ... We need to be cautious about the kind of direct financial investments we are going to be asked to make at a time when we have limited resources.''", " High-ranking government and rebel delegations agreed on a 10-day suspension of direct peace talks after a fourth day of negotiations failed to produce a definitive cease-fire pact. Also Monday, President Daniel Ortega warned that Sandinista troops would continue fighting the U.S.-backed rebel forces if rebel negotiators bowed to pressure from their top military commander not to sign an accord. A joint communique issued at the end of Monday's talks said the government and the Contras, as the rebels are known, would next meet in Managua April 28-30 to continue negotiations to end their 6{-year-old civil war. The statement described talks between Sandinista officials and leaders of the Contras' Nicaraguan Resistance organization as ``frank and cordial,'' and said the two sides had entered into ``permanent session'' to reach an accord. Contra leader Pedro Joaquin Chamorro told reporters that government and rebel officials had agreed ``that at any moment we can renew the negotiations to give continuity to this process.'' ``We are certain the negotiations will end in success,'' said Nicaraguan Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, who headed the government's negotiating team. President Ortega, the defense minister's brother, charged that Col. Enrique Bermudez, the Contra military commander, and the United States were pressuring rebel negotiators to avoid a cease-fire agreement. According to Ortega, Bermudez threatened the Resistance directorate saying rebel military forces ``would liquidate them'' if they signed an agreement with the government. ``If this happens, it would leave us no other road but to achieve a total victory in the military field,'' Ortega told thousands of government supporters gathered in Managua's Plaza de la Revolucion on Monday evening. Alfredo Cesar and Adolfo Calero, leaders of the Resistance directorate, denied Ortega's claim. The directorate's six members arrived in Managua on Friday for the first time since the civil war began in November 1981. They left the country Monday evening. Officials from both sides declined to provide details on the latest round of talks. Humberto Ortega said they were ``an advance and not a failure,'' while Calero, the highest-ranking Resistance official, told reporters that both sides were ``on the road to an understanding.'' Negotiations reportedly stalled over the issue of when the Sandinistas would introduce democratic reforms in Nicaragua. Arriving in Miami on Monday night, Calero said that would be the top issue when talks resume. The Sandinistas insist the rebels sign a permanent truce immediately. They say Contra delegates would then be allowed to take part in a ``national reconciliation dialogue'' with leaders of Nicaragua's 14 legally recognized political parties. Contra leaders demand the Sandinistas first carry out a series of democratic reforms, or at least pledge to do so, before they will sign a pact. The two sides signed a provisional agreement on March 23 which provided for a temporary cease-fire while they negotiated a permanent truce. A 60-day cease-fire went into effect April 1. The Contras on Monday proposed that the temporary cease-fire be extended another month while both sides seek agreement. There was no immediate government response.", " Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and European Economic Community officials agreed Tuesday to step up trade contacts. Takeshita responded favorably to a suggestion by EEC Commission President Jacques Delors to create a panel of experts to discuss technical aspects of the EEC's rocky trade relations with Japan, officials said. Takeshita also stressed the need for Japan and the 12-nation EEC to widen their relations beyond trade to cultural and scientific sectors. ``The relationship between Europe and Japan is not very strong or as well developed'' as that between the United States with Europe and Japan, an aide to Takeshita told reporters. Senior EEC and Japanese officials meet annually. An EEC official said Delors believed regular meetings of experts could be useful in defusing trade tensions. The EEC is conducting numerous investigations of allegations of dumping by Japanese exporters. The EEC official, who asked not to be named, said EEC Foreign Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq noted a ``remarkable improvement in trade relations'' between the 12-nation trade bloc and Japan, even though the EEC continues to register a large trade deficit with Japan. The gap shrank by 4 percent in 1987, but was still $25 billion. For his part, Takeshita said the EEC's plans to turn the 12 EEC states into a single, borderless market by the end of 1992 was good for Japan. But his aide quoted him as saying, ``The ... single market after 1992 should be the one which is open to the outside world'' and that the EEC should remove restrictions on Japanese exports. But he dismissed the idea of reciprocity in trade, an issue the EEC has given high priority in order to gain greater access for European goods to the Japanese market. ``We fully understand what (the EEC) Commission people are saying on reciprocity but Japan cannot agree to reciprocity on a sectoral basis,'' Takeshita was quoted as saying. Among specific trade issues discussed were Japan's high taxes on imported liquor and cars, the difficulties of foreign companies' bidding on Japanese public works projects and better access for EEC exports of telecommunications hardware and semiconductors. The EEC side also urged Japan to liberalize its banking sector. Officials said Delors stressed European banks must be able to establish themselves in Japan to make it easier to finance European exports and investments. De Clercq also called on Japan to quickly comply with a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ruling to amend an accord with the United States on trade in semiconductors. The world trade body has ruled the deal discriminates against the EEC. Takeshita also asked Delors' advice as to the best way to distribute $500 million Japan has earmarked as special economic assistance to Africa. ``We are aware that European countries have a long relationship with African countries,'' the aide quoted Takeshita as saying.", " ``We are not undertaking any biological war. Neither troops nor caterpillars will go in without prior request and consultation.'' _ Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, on an Agriculture Department program that is researching development of voracious caterpillars to kill off drug-producing coca plants in South American jungles.", " Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today opened the most ambitious trade negotiations ever undertaken, urging officials of 90 nations to compromise to resolve trade differences. In an apparent reference to a clash between the United States and its allies on farm subsidies, Mulroney exhorted the delegates to ``be motivated by a spirit of honorable compromise.'' Mulroney said farmers around the world ``are looking for results in Montreal. They can no longer survive on a diet of promises.'' The round of trade negotiations is designed to liberalize and broaden the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trade-policing treaty signed in 1947. GATT now has 96 members, and 90 trade ministers were at today's meeting. The U.S. delegation has come under strong criticism from Japan, Australia and the European Community over its demand to completely eliminate government supports for farmers. The 12-nation European Community is only willing to reduce them, terming the U.S. position unrealistic. Mulroney urged the negotiators to ``be animated by a spirit of realism,'' echoing similar weekend calls to the United States in preparatory consultations for the mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round of trade talks. The United States was further isolated by a tentative accord reached between the Europeans and developing nations that would remove or reduce tariffs on the export of tropical products to the industrialized world. An EC spokeswoman said the United States did not yet support the agreement, which would affect $70 billion in internaional trade of such products as jute, bananas and coffee. Michael Duffy, Australia's Minister of Trade Negotiations, told reporters Sunday that blame for U.S.-European impasse over trade barriers should be shared by the two parties. But he and other officials looked to the Americans to make the first move. Duffy warned that if neither side compromises during the three-day talks, ``it will sour the rest of the round,'' which ends in 1990. The dispute over agricultural subsidies has clouded prospects for progress on other urgent trade problems, such as the inclusion of the booming services trade in the 40-year-old GATT pact and the adoption of safeguards for copyrights and patents. ``It's hard to see how there can be progress in other areas without progress in agriculture,'' said John Crosbie, Canada's Minister for International Trade. The United States took a conciliatory stand but insisted it would stick to its main objective. Chief agriculture negotiator Dan Amstutz noted the United States had moved away from setting a 2000 deadline for elimination of subsidies and agreed to emergency government food stockpiles as long as they are bought on the open market. ``We're flexible,'' he said, but ``we'd rather not have any agreement than a bad one.'' The U.S. delegation also appeared to hold out the possibility it would relent on its rejection of a proposal lifting barriers on the export of tropical products, such as bananas and coconuts, by developing nations. U.S. trade negotiator Alan Holmer warned that failure by the GATT round could create ``uncertainties'' in Congress and within the incoming administration of George Bush. He did not elaborate. But Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said failure on the farm support issue would result in an ``export-oriented'' farm bill. Congress is scheduled to draft a farm bill next year and Leahy indicated it would include supports for farmers so they can compete effectively against farmers whose governments also subsidize exports. The United States projects that its 1989 farm supports will amount to $13 billion _ down from the $27 million of 1987 but still a heavy burden on the deficit-ridden budget. U.S. officials say Europeans could save about $200 billion every year if they stopped their farm supports. But the EC, under the influence of powerful farm lobbies, says eliminating supports is not a viable option.", " President Bush on Thursday hailed a trade reform agreement with Japan as ``an important framework'' for reducing the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Tokyo. The president said he welcomed the joint report Thursday by U.S. and Japanese negotiators in Tokyo. In it the two countries identified internal economic practices that hinder open trade, took corrective actions, and ``made commitments to take further steps to resolve a wide range of structural problems,'' Bush said in a written statement. ``We expect that the structural policy actions to be taken will have a positive effect on our economies, encouraging open and competitive markets, promoting sustained world economic growth, contributing to a reduction in global payments imbalance, and enhancing the quality of life in both Japan and the United States,'' he said. Further, the president said in the statement, the U.S.-Japan agreement will benefit ``the entire world.'' Bush was expected to discuss the matter further on Saturday when he meets with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Houston where both are attending the economic summit of industrialized nations. The agreement Thursday emerged from a series of complex negotiations called the Structural Impediments Initiative, or SII, involving the removal of barriers to open trading. The joint report in Tokyo followed Bush's acknowledgment this week that new taxes may be needed to reduce the U.S. federal deficit, a key factor in getting the agreement, officials said. The announcement that the president would consider such taxes was followed by a Japanese compromise Wednesday to increase planned public works spending. That might help reduce the trade imbalance by increasing sales of U.S. products and construction services in Japan and soaking up some excess Japanese savings and investment funds. ``As Japan tackles its structural problems,'' Bush said in his statement, ``so must the United States.'' The president said he wants to work closely with Congress in the ongoing budget negotiations to strengthen public and private savings and lower the deficit. ``Both our governments recognize that further effort will be necessary in order to address fully these structural problems and to maintain the momentum of our adjustment efforts,'' Bush said. Bush lauded Kaifu for his personal efforts in fashioning the agreement and for ``strong and courageous political leadership.''", " The Sandinista government proposed on Thursday that the two-month cease-fire be extended by 30 days to allow negotiators to work out an enduring peace with rebels, but the rebels immediately said no. Azucena Ferrey, spokeswoman for the rebels, known as the Contras, said the Sandinista proposal ``shows they lack good will.'' She noted in a telephone interview that the current cease-fire expires at the end of May, and said that ``if they want to extend it (the cease-fire) they can propose it then.'' Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense minister and the leader of the leftist government's delegation to the peace talks, told reporters such an extension ``will help improve the conditions under which the negotiations are taking place so that an overall agreement can be discussed to reach a final accord.'' The 60-day provisional truce, which started April 1, is part of an agreement reached by the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinistas at the southern border post of Sapoa on March 23. During the truce the two sides are to attempt to negotiate an end to the 6{-year-old conflict that has cost more than 26,000 lives, by government estimates. Ortega, the brother of President Daniel Ortega, announced the offer shortly before the delegations resumed high-level political talks. The government also offered Thursday to let the International Red Cross administer humanitarian aid immediately to the Contras even before rebel combatants gather inside safe zones established during previous talks. The Sandinista proposal was read by Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco, who said the offer was ``an attempt to facilitate the pacification process.'' Sandinista and Contra negotiators previously agreed upon seven safe zones in which the Contra fighters are to collect. The two sides differed over operational conditions inside the zones, however, and the rebels have yet to gather inside them. The three-day negotiating session marks only the second time the two sides have met in Managua since the war began in 1981. Recent reports have said that the Contra leadership is divided, with the rebel military commanders opposing any immediate agreement with the Sandinistas. President Ortega on Wednesday predicted an agreement can be reached if both sides bargain in good faith. However, the Sandinistas and the Contras remain far apart on essential issues. Humberto Ortega accused the rebel commanders of taking part in the talks ``not with the purpose of reaching agreement'' but to buy time. American and other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said rebel leader Adolfo Calero tried unsuccessfully to oust the top rebel military commander, Enrique Bermudez, a week ago. A U.S. official said the Contra directors split 2-2 with one abstention on whether to remove Bermudez. He ostensibly takes orders from the five-member civilian directorate but believes he should have more influence over rebel decisions, the sources said. Calero argues that civilian control over the movement is essential and sees Bermudez as a threat to that objective. In an effort to dispel rumors of disunity, Bermudez and other Contra leaders issued a statement in Miami on Wednesday declaring support for the talks. Calero, in a telephone interview Thursday, denied there was any split in rebel ranks. ``There are obviously sectors who would be interested in there being such a split,'' he said.", " Future peace talks between Nicaragua's leftist government and its Contra rebels are likely to have a political hue the Sandinistas never wanted. The government appeared to open the door to political discussions with its armed opponents by belatedly agreeing in principle last week to a proposal by the mediator of the negotiations, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, head of the Roman Catholic Church in Nicaragua. That proposal called on the Contras to accept a cease-fire in exchange for four major concessions by the Sandinista government. The concessions were something the Contras had been seeking, and they were quick to accept the cardinal's plan. The government was called upon to grant unrestricted freedom of the press and a total, unconditional amnesty for political prisoners, renew a dialogue with its internal opposition and review its universal military conscription law. Whether it was a tactical error or a considered response, the Sandinistas delayed in taking a position that President Daniel Ortega has long and strenuously opposed. On innumerable occasions in the past, he has said he would never discuss political matters with the Contras. ``We don't want to create the impression that we don't want a cease-fire and are being intransigent,'' said Paul Reichler, a Washington, D.C., attorney who advises the Sandinistas. ``At all costs, we want the negotiations to go forward.'' Reichler's comments came in a chat with reporters Friday after Obando y Bravo abruptly suspended the latest round of peace talks a day before they were supposed to end and obliquely blamed the Sandinistas for the breakdown. Ortega said Saturday in Managua that the cardinal's proposal ``was not rejected'' by the Sandinistas and said his government ``is willing to continue the conversations.'' But a clarification was needed on the withdrawal of the Contras to enclaves during the truce, Ortega said at the close of a government meeting. He repeated that his government is willing to apply an amnesty once a cease-fire is in effect. Referring to the military draft, he said ``it is logical that with the end of the war the military service will not require the current volume (of soldiers).'' Ortega told the meeting on new economic measures aimed at fighting inflation that ``enemies of the revolution'' opposed the measures. He said the right, the extreme left and the opposition daily La Prensa should be careful not to stir up insurrection. The cardinal said after his return to Managua on Saturday that with the suspension of talks, ``We have given time for reflection since there is a lack of trust between the two sides.'' Appearances are of vital importance to both sides, with neither party wanting to be seen as the spoiler as long as there is any remaining chance the U.S. Congress might approve additional military aid for the Contras. In private talks with reporters, the Sandinistas made it clear that they were initially surprised by the cardinal's five-point proposal, then disappointed by his abrupt cancellation of the talks. Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, said Obando halted the negotiations Friday afternoon before he had a chance to deliver the government's formal, written response to the proposal the cardinal put forth Thursday. But Tinoco insisted that he had discussed the government's position at length with the cardinal Friday morning and had not been given any reason to believe that the cardinal was unwilling to continue the negotiations. The cardinal ``did not tell us he disagreed'' with the government's position, Reichler told reporters later. In its written response, the government declared its ``agreement in principle'' with the cardinal's proposal, but carefully conditioned its answers to his requests that it reconsider its mandatory draft law and grant an unconditional amnesty to the thousands of political prisoners in Nicaraguan jails. But before Nicaragua's formal response was delivered, Obando had canceled the talks, saying he was disappointed that both sides had not accepted his proposal, at least in principle. The remark was clearly aimed at the Sandinistas. But late or not, the government's response clearly put such political matters as press freedom and amnesty on the bargaining table for further talks and, given the opening, the Contras are likely to push for even greater concessions. The cardinal is expected to announce a time and place for a third round of face-to-face negotiations sometime this week. The first round of talks took place in San Jose, Costa Rica, in late January, only a week before the House rejected President Reagan's latest request for about $43 million in additional Contra aid. But the administration is considering a new bid for military aid for the rebels, and as long as that possibility exists, both sides will be playing their cards cautiously at the bargaining table.", " President Bush and his advisers went over final preparations today for a U.S.-Soviet summit that a top aide said will tackle ``bare bone essentials'' rather than tallying up agreements to sign. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will likely issue a statement of progress on nuclear arms reductio as sign various cultural and economic agreements when they meet this week, said a senior admin talks, as wellnistration official who briefed White House reporters. But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, cast doubt on prospects for a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement before Gorbachev leaves. ``We're in a rather uncertain state about what exactly will happen on the trade agreement,'' the official said, citing U.S. unhappiness over Soviet actions in Lithuania and the Soviets' failure to enact legislation allowing free emigration. Still, the official said, ``This is not a summit devoted to the celebration of agreements that we can sign. It is a summit designed to do the hard work of trying to overcome the remaining obstacles that stand in the way of transforming East-West relations.'' ``We are now dow: Education Program.", " Christian and Moslem militiamen today exchanged mortar fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line. No casualties were reported. The two-hour battle in downtown Beirut came amid reports of growing tension between a Christian militia and the Lebanese army. There was no word on what caused the battle, the fourth between civil war antagonists in Beirut in two weeks. The clashes have strained a 14-month-old truce in the war that began in 1975. The fighting coincided with a state of alert proclaimed by the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, in east Beirut and the Christian heartland north of the capital. Christian militiamen set up checkpoints and roadblocks all over the Christian sector of Beirut and along the main coastal highway running north from the city, witnesses reported. Fighters in battle fatigues and carrying automatic weapons searched cars and frisked occupants, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The militia gave no explanation for the alert. But the Christian-owned Ad-Diyar daily said it stemmed from tension between the militia and the Lebanese army, which is controlled by Christian officers. The newspaper said the militia was putting on a muscle-flexing show to demonstrate it controls the Christian enclave, not the army. The commander of the 37,000-man army, Gen. Michel Aoun, has been quoted by several Beirut newspapers recently as saying the military could finish off the militia any time it wanted. Newspapers said his remarks were part of a campaign by the Maronite Catholic commander to become the next president of Lebanon after President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires in September. Aoun, who has not denied the statements, has not offically proclaimed his candidacy.", " Rebels said Friday they had overrun three more government garrisons in southern Sudan and beaten back a military convoy trying to stage a rescue mission. In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Sudan People's Liberation Army said it captured Kologi in southern Kordofan province on Wednesday ``after seven days of heavy fighting preceded by a one-month siege.'' The broadcast said rebel forces also ambushed a 33-vehicle convoy, including four tanks, that was trying to reach Kologi and ``forced it to retreat with heavy losses.'' The rebels also claimed the capture of two smaller garrison towns, Bazia on Jan. 24 and Amati on Wednesday. The report could not be independently confirmed, but if true would bring to more than 15 the number of garrisons captured by the rebels the past three months.", " Police today detained about 10,000 Hindu students on their way to a protest rally in the Kashmir Valley, where a day earlier 21 Moslems were killed in a reported shootout. The caravan of buses and trucks that was stopped in Udhampur, 45 miles north of Jammu, was headed toward Srinagar, where the Hindu activists of the All India Students' Federation had planned to hoist Indian flags. The government, fearing violence, had appealed to the Hindu activists not to hold their procession to Srinagar, a Moslem stronghold in Kashmir, the northern sector of Jammu-Kashmir state. The students, based in Jammu in a predominantly Hindu sector, had ignored the official pleas. The Hindu students are opposed to a Moslem secessionist movement that is attempting to get independence for Jammu-Kashmir state, the only Indian state in which the majority of the population is Moslem. The students were arrested without resistance, one official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. They were expected to be released after a few hours without charges being pressed. In Srinagar, shops were closed and traffic stayed off the roads today in response to a general strike call given by Moslem militants. The strike was to protest the deaths of 21 Kashmiris Tuesday during a shoot-out with paramiltary troops near Srinagar. The government claimed all the victims, including 17 people in a bus which exploded and caught fire, were militants. A government statement said the bus exploded when a stray bullet hit a pile of ammunition inside it. At least 1,175 people have ben killed in Kashmir since January, when the government started a crackdown on the secessionists. About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslems. About 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus while Moslems account for 12 percent.", " Moslem militants fighting for Kashmir's secession from India opened fire today on air force officers, killing at least four, police said. The killings raised to at least 61 the number of people killed in Kashmir since Saturday, when the lingering Moslem movement for secession from Hindu-majority India flared. Most of the killings have occured in confrontations between troops enforcing an around-the-clock curfew and mobs of militants defying the curfew. ``The attack makes it clear that the terrorists want to make targets of anyone who is associated with the Indian government,'' said a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The air force officers were waiting for a bus to take them to the Srinagar airport when they were attacked by assailants who drove up in a car, the police official said. Three of the officers were killed on the spot in repeated bursts of fire from automatic rifles and at least four others were wounded, two of them seriously, he said. One of the wounded died at a hospital. A woman and a child walking by were also hurt, the official said. Witnesses said they saw at least five bodies being carried away after the shooting. Hundreds of troops and paramilitary police have been deployed to halt the violence in Srinagar, famous for its lakes and tourist resorts. Troops and the militants exchanged gunfire at four places in the city during a four-hour curfew relaxation which began at 5 a.m. today, police said. No deaths were reported although one para-military policeman was wounded, police said. Under the curfew imposed Saturday, people have been ordered to stay indoors except for brief periods when the ban is lifted to enable people to shop. Islamic militants are demanding either independence for predominantly Moslem Kashmir or union with neighboring Islamic Pakistan. Kashmir forms the northern part of Jammu-Kashmir state and Srinagar is the summer capital. The Jammu region, which lies south of Kashmir, is predominantly Hindu. Claimed by India and Pakistan, Kashmir was divided into Indian and Pakistani sectors by a cease-fire line that is monitored by U.N. military observers. The dispute over the territory, which has led to two wars, began after India and Pakistan were partitioned on gaining independence from Britain in 1947. India has often accused Pakistan of aiding Kashmiri militants, and Pakistan has routinely denied the charge. About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus make up 82 percent.", " A fire in a village in the central Blue Nile region killed four people and left more than 500 families homeless, the state-run Sudan News Agency said Sunday. A woman and three children were killed when the fire raged through Bott, a village of 2,500 people, the report said. The blaze destroyed the families' homes, burned the local market and killed scores of domestic animals, the news agency said. It did not say when the fire broke out or how it started.", " Three men planting explosives near a British military barracks today fired at a guard before fleeing their bungled bombing attempt, officials said. Investigators later found 65 pounds of the high-powered explosive Semtex in three satchels outside a housing block at the British army's Langenhagen Barracks in Hanover, British military officials said. It was not known who was responsible. A Ministry of Defense spokesman in London said: ``We cannot say the men were IRA at this moment in time. All we can say is that they were terrorists.'' The Irish Republican Army has been blamed for numerous attacks against British military installations in West Germany over the past few years. The IRA has waged a campaign to drive the British from Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelming Roman Catholic Irish Republic. According to police, a civilian guard making the rounds with a security dog noticed three suspicious people on the barracks grounds about 2 a.m. Three shots were fired by the people, said a British military spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the guard was not injured. Col. Henry Day, Chief of Public Information for the British Forces in Germany, said the attackers had cut a hole in the barracks' perimeter fence. He told British Broadcasting Corp. radio that 70 soldiers were moved from the building. ``It was Semtex, with a wire timing device,'' Day said. He said one satchel contained 10 blocks of explosives, and the second nine blocks. He said he had no details on the third.", " A ``human bomb'' attack, similar to last month's IRA bombing which killed seven people, failed when the enormous bomb fizzled, police said Friday. No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday night's failed attack but a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabular said the Irish Republican Army was suspected. The RUC spokesman said armed, masked men kidnapped a man from his home near Newtown Butler and ordered him to drive a truck containing a 3,500-pound bomb to an army checkpoint at Annaghmartin. The gang tied up the man's elderly parents and locked them in a bathroom while the man was driven near the checkpoint, 56 miles southwest of Belfast. The man was told to deliver the bomb, which they said had a five-minute timer, police said. The man drove the red pickup to the checkpoint, jumped out and shouted a warning. A short time later there was a small explosion, which was believed to have been caused by the detonator going off, police said. Army bomb experts defused the bomb, one of the largest ever found in Northern Ireland, police said. The army said there was only minimal damage and no one was injured. On Oct. 24, the IRA staged three human bomb attacks which killed six soldiers and a civilian, who drove one of the bombs to the army targets. The IRA is fighting British rule in Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland, under socialist rule.", " Police clashed with about 250 stone-throwing Moslem fundamentalists who attacked a theater troupe, a security source said Wednesday. One student was killed and four were injured as officers dispersed the crowd. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the incident took place Tuesday night at the village of Kodeya, 25 miles from the southern provincial capital of Assiut. He said it wasn't known what killed 23-year-old Mohammed Kotb. One of the four wounded students was in critical condition, he added. In a statement read to The Associated Press by telephone, a fundamentalist spokesman claimed the student was killed by police gunfire. ``The Moslem group went out through the village in a peaceful march of protest ... when police attacked them with tear gas and opened fire on the demonstrators, killing the student Mohammed Kotb,'' the statement said. The spokesman, who refused to give his name, said forces then surrounded the village, raided homes and detained fundamentalists. The spokesman said the students were protesting a ``dancing party'' organized by security forces. The security source, however, said the fundamentalists attacked a theater troupe performing a play about Islam and peasants. The troup had been invited to perform by the government's culture club at the village. ``Around 250 Moslem fundamentalists from the village and nearby villages gathered in a mosque after evening prayers and then moved to the hall where the play was being performed, carrying stones and rocks,'' the source said. He said the students, from a teacher training college, ``attacked the hall and tried to destroy the building,'' but security forces surrounded them and used tear gas and sticks to disperse them. He did not say whether police made any arrests. Police forces guarded the building until the play was finished, the source said. The southern Assiut province has been a hotbed of fundamentalist agitation for almost a decade. Fundamentalist students armed with knives, bicycle chains and stones, attacked an Assiut University campus parade on March 7, denouncing it as an anti-Islamic ``dancing and singing party.'' In the ensuing clash with security forces, two students and two policemen were wounded.", " Eight bombs exploded today in the stronghold of Moslem militants seeking independence for the Himalayan valley of Kashmir, authorities said. No one was injured. Authorities said the blasts, at two banks, a post office and other shops and businesses, occurred hours after fire swept through a shopping complex in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. No one claimed responsibilty for the explosions. Police said they believe the blaze was an accident since it occurred before dawn while a curfew was still in force. But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, blamed the fire and the bombs on the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, the militant group leading the four-decade-old drive for the country's only Moslem majority state to secede from predominantly Hindu India. India routinely blames neighoring Pakistan of arming, training and supporting the militants. Pakistan denies the charge but says the Kashmiri people have a right to self-determination. At least 82 people have been killed since Jan. 20 in frequent street clashes between militants and security forces in Srinagar and adjoining areas. Most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying curfew imposed by government forces to stem rising violence. The curfew was relaxed during the day from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m., except in the areas where the explosions occurred. Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir. Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems, but Moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million population nationwide. Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population, but the militants now demand independence and the status of a neutral country. India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir.", " Tamil rebels hiding behind bushes opened fire on a bus and its army escort Saturday, killing 10 people and injuring six others, officials said. The military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said five Sinhalese soldiers and five civilians were killed in the attack in dense jungle near Vavuniya, about 135 miles north of Colombo. More than 50 guerrillas fired from both sides of the road, the officials said. ``The soldiers were escorting the civilian bus, and they died fighting the attackers. We believe the attackers suffered heavy casualties, but we don't have details,'' one official said. He said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil militia, was responsible for the attack. The ambush came a day after President Junius R. Jayewardene's United National Party won a majority of seats to four new district councils. The elections were boycotted by major opposition parties. Tamil militants have been fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government for a separate homeland in northern and eastern provinces for five years. In July, India and Sri Lanka signed a peace accord aimed at ending the ethnic war by granting some autonomy to the minority Tamils. The accord has been rejected by the Tamil Tigers, who control major areas of Northern Province. India has sent more than 50,000 troops to its island neighbor to disarm the Tigers and enforce the accord. The predominantly Hindu Tamils, who are 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. India, also predominantly Hindu, intervened at the request of its own large Tamil minority.", " The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities in November rose to the highest level in nine years, the government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about inflation. The Federal Reserve Board said the use of industrial capacity rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest since 84.3 percent in November 1979. It was the seventh increase in eight months. As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. In an accompanying report, the Federal Reserve said industrial production climbed a brisk 0.5 percent in November following an identical 0.5 percent rise in October. The Fed's industrial production index now stands at 139.9 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and production of equipment for businesses. The jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line with economists' expectations. Most government statistics have portrayed a robust economy in October and November, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which has been bolstered by strong export sales caused by the lower value of the dollar, which makes U.S. goods more affordable on overseas markets. At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.5 percent last month, up from 84.3 percent in October. Producers of both durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items ranging from bicycles to battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher rates. The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in November, up from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded a 0.1 percentage point gain to 86.5 percent. The Fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the increase was attributed to increases at steel mills. Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in light truck production. Automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to 76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent. The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9 percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning. In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6 percent in October. The Federal Reserve's production index has not declined since September 1987, a reflection of the export-driven manufacturing boom. A related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand and modernize factories has accompanied the boom. Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in November, following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October. The Fed said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million units, down slightly from October. But production of business equipment rose 0.4 percent following a flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago. Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose 0.6 percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at utilities increased 0.4 percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in October. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent higher than a year ago.", " Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities shot up 0.7 percent in April, the biggest gain in six months, the government reported today. The Federal Reserve said the April advance followed increases of 0.4 percent in January and 0.2 percent in March and no change at all in February. It was the largest advance since a 1.1 percent surge last October. The increase was in line with expectations as economists had predicted a strong showing based on a pickup in production at auto factories. Autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7 million units last month, up from a rate of 6.6 million units in March. With the latest improvement, overall industrial production is now 6.4 percent higher than it was a year ago, a further sign of the resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing sector, which has enjoyed booming export sales because of the decline in the value of the dollar. The Reagan administration is counting on further reductions in the U.S. trade deficit to contribute almost half of the expected growth in the overall economy this year. The April advance in industrial output followed a period of generally sluggish activity in the first part of the year as production gains slowed while manufacturers, particularly in the auto industry, tried to work down an overhang of unsold goods. Still, the production slowdown was much less severe than had been feared immediately after the October stock market collapse. At that time, some economists believed that a drop in consumer spending would force such steep cuts in production that the country would be pushed into a recession. Instead, the overall economy expanded at a moderate 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, as measured by the gross national product. The April report showed that output in the manufacturing sector climbed 0.7 percent in April, reflecting an increase of 0.9 percent in the production of durable goods, items expected to last three years or more, and a 0.4 percent rise in non-durable production. Output in the mining industry jumped 1.3 percent in April, following a 0.7 percent March increase. The strong gains in both of those months followed a string of declines. This sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, has been depressed because of falling oil prices. Output at the nation's utilities fell 0.8 percent in April, following an even larger 1.1 percent drop in March. The various changes left the industrial production index at 135.6 in April, up from 134.7 in March.", " Retail prices in Britain were up 10.6 percent in August compared to levels a year earlier, the highest rate of inflation since 1982, the government reported Friday. Higher prices for gasoline, heating oil, food and beer pushed the index up 1.0 percent between July and August, the Central Statistical Office said. The last time inflation was in double figures was in March 1982 when the rate was 10.4 percent. Excluding mortgages and local taxes, the rate of increase was 7.9 percent in August, up from 7.0 percent in July, the government said.", " Existing home sales in March remained below 1989 levels for the second straight month as mortgage interest rates stayed in the double-digits, a real estate trade group reported Wednesday. The National Association of Realtors said resales of single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.40 million units, unchanged from the number of sales in February but down from the 3.52 million rate in January. The annual rate for a particular month represents what the total number of sales for the year would be if the pace were maintained for 12 consecutive months. During all of 1989, actual sales totaled 3.44 million units. Realtors chief economist John A. Tuccillo said the 3.40 million pace, the slowest since a 3.38 million rate last July, was sustainable for the rest of the year. The Commerce Department is scheduled to report new home sales for March next Monday. New home sales rose 3.1 percent to an annual rate of 607,000 units in February after plunging 6.8 percent the previous month. But the pace of sales remained below the 649,000 new homes sold in 1989 and analysts placed the blame on mortgage rates and declining consumer confidence. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported that 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages averaged between 10.22 percent and 10.34 percent during March, high when compared to the single-digit rates at the end of 1989. The Realtors said the high rates had a dual effect on the existing home market. Consumer uncertainty triggered purchases by prospective buyers fearing higher rates in the future while it curbed sales by others hoping for lower rates in the months ahead. ``The rate-watchers who are making their move now tend to be in less expensive markets,'' said Realtors president Norman D. Flynn. ``Those who are holding back in hopes of rate declines tend to be in the higher-priced markets.'' The Realtors said the national median price of existing homes was $96,100 in March, up $900 from February. The median price of a new home in February was $130,000, according to the Commerce Department. The median means that half of the homes cost more, half less. Existing home sales in the Northeast continued to be sluggish in March, falling 16.9 percent to an annual rate of 490,000 units. The median price there was $148,200, up 3.3 percent from the previous month. Sales also fell in the West, down 1.5 percent to an annual rate of 640,000. The median price was $143,300, the same as February's. Sales were unchanged at an annual rate of 890,000 units in the Midwest where the median price was $72,900, down 1.6 percent. The South posted the only sales gain, up 3.8 percent to 1.36 million units. The median price was up 0.9 percent to $86,000.", " The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 5.3 percent last month as gains in service industries offset the ninth consecutive monthly drop in manufacturing jobs, the Labor Department said. The steady civilian jobless rate, which ended 1989 just under the level where it began, gave private analysts hope Friday that the economy's current sluggish growth will not worsen into a recession.", " The Commerce Department reported Thursday that orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, excluding the volatile defense category, climbed 1.8 percent in November, a healthy increase which economists took as a sign of continued strength in the new year. When defense orders are included, total durable goods orders edged up only 0.1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $122.89 billion. That followed a giant 2.9 percent rise in October. The overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military orders in October and then depressed when military orders returned to more normal levels last month. Discounting the swings in defense, orders in the civilian category climbed 1.8 percent in November, the best showing since a 5.2 percent August increase. Civilian orders had risen only 0.2 percent in October. Analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilian orders, saying the orders should keep U.S. plants humming through the first half of 1989. ``This was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insure that the economy will keep growing next year,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. Analysts were particularly impressed with a 2.6 percent rise in orders for business capital goods, which rose to $35.5 billion. This industry is closely watched for signals of business intentions to expand and modernize. It was the first increase in this category after two consecutive monthly declines and eased fears that business investment could be tapering off. ``With business investment bouncing back up, there is a lot less reason to worry about next year,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. ``On the whole, things look pretty good, with strong shipments and strong orders promising continued growth.'' The manufacturing sector has been a driving force in the economy this year as U.S. companies have benefited from a weaker dollar which has boosted overseas sales. The boom in exports has in turn led to a surge in investment spending as businesses rushed to expanded production facilities. For November, much of the strength in durable goods _ items expected to last at least three years _ came from an 8.1 percent rise in demand for electrical machinery, which climbed to $20.5 billion. Much of this increase reflected rising demand for defense communications equipment. Total defense orders, however, fell by 17.6 percent to $8.81 billion following a 43.1 percent surge in October. The defense category is highly erratic, depending on when big government contracts are signed. Transportation orders fell 6.3 percent to $32.69 billion as virtually all categories except civilian aircraft suffered setbacks. Orders for non-electrical machinery edged down 0.5 percent to $21.05 billion, the third consecutive decline. Orders for primary metals rose 0.8 percent to $12.52 billion and now stand 11.4 percent higher than they were a year ago. Shipments of durable goods increased 1 percent to $119.6 billion in November, following a 0.3 percent advance in October.", " Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods plunged 2.2 percent in May, the steepest dive in nine months, the government said today. The Commerce Department said orders for durables goods, items expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $114.8 billion last month. It was the biggest drop in new orders since August, when orders plummeted 2.3 percent, and followed a 1.8 percent increase in April, revised upward from a previous estimate of 1.0 percent. The entire May decline can be accounted for by a precipitous 9 percent decline in orders for transportation equipment. At the White House, spokesman B. Jay Cooper called the report on new orders ``volatile. May's decline should not be cause for concern. Shipments continue to show strength and the backlog of unfilled orders remains high.'' ``More news that inflation remains under control. It is good news,'' Copper added. Economists were surprised by the report. Most had predicted a rise of more than 2 percent in orders on the strength of two big orders late in May to Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co., one from United Airlines, the other from American Airlines. But those orders apparently were not recorded in the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate of durable goods. Excluding transportation, orders increased 0.3 percent. Excluding just aircraft, overall orders increased 0.6 percent. Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, said excluding aircraft and defense, order levels are ``not half bad.'' ``I think what we're seeing is what we want to see, which is continued growth, but maybe some moderation of the pace,'' she said. Stronger growth would inject inflation pressure into the economy, she said. Orders in the volatile defense goods category fell 16.6 percent to $8.3 billion, following an increase of 1.9 percent a month earlier. Excluding defense, orders declined 0.9 percent following a 1.8 percent rise in April. The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a sign of business expansion plans, fell 6.9 percent last month, following a 3.4 percent rise a month earlier. Despite the setback in May, analysts still expect export-producing manufacturers to spend heavily on modernization and expansion. Orders for primary metals, such as steel, zoomed 5.5 percent following a 1.6 percent rise in April. Orders for electrical machinery also posted a strong gain, 3.5 percent, following a 5.0 percent rise a month before. There was a 2.4 percent decline in orders for non-electrical machinery, more than erasing a 1.2 percent gain in April. Shipments of durable goods rose 1.5 percent in May to $114.4 billion, following a 0.9 percent decline in April.", " Housing construction rose a moderate 2.4 percent in July, the government reports, but economists warn that rising mortgage rates could make the two-month housing rebound a brief one. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million units last month after advancing 4.4 percent in June. Housing starts dropped a sharp 12.1 percent in May to the slowest pace in three years, and rising mortgage rates were blamed.", " Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. reported a 28 percent drop in second-quarter earnings Thursday, saying high interest rates have hurt its major markets. The supplier of construction and industrial materials said earnings for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $39 million or 92 cents per share, vs. $54 million or $1.28 per share during the year-earlier period. Second-quarter sales totaled $771 million vs. $721 million. The 1990 figures, unlike those of 1989, include results from Fiberglas Canada. ``These results reflect weakness in our major markets, including new housing construction, pleasure boats and automobiles,'' said William W. Boeschenstein, chairman and chief executive officer. ``They are all being hurt by continued high interest rates and cautious consumer buying.'' Owens-Corning said most areas of its Construction Products business were down during the quarter, thanks to declining new housing and commercial construction. But sales of insulation and roofing products for home improvements and remodeling held steady. Sales for the company's Industrial Materials Group were up slightly during the quarter because of the addition of the results from Fiberglas Canada. However, Owens-Corning said demand for industrial materials appeared to be weakening in North America and in Europe. For the first six months, Owens-Corning said earnings totaled $71 million, or $1.68 per share, compared with $89 million, or $2.10 per share, during the first six months of 1989. Sales totaled $1.5 billion vs. $1.4 billion.", " The nation's economy nearly came to a standstill in the second quarter, edging up a feeble annual rate of 0.4 percent, the government said Tuesday. Many of the nation's top economists believe a recession is imminent - if not under way already. While White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we don't believe we are in a recession right now,'' he acknowledged the latest Commerce Department report on the gross national product ``is certainly cause for concern. It's not good news.'' The department's revised report on the GNP - the nation's total output of goods and services - was the lowest since a 0.3 percent rate during the last quarter of 1989 and showed the economy weakening even before the Persian Gulf crisis. ``The economy was headed toward a recession before Iraq, and Iraq was just the nail in the coffin,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co. A recession ``seems inescapable,'' he said. Surveys following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait - and the subsequent oil-price spiral - showed many top economists forecasting an imminent recession. The National Association of Business Economists reported Tuesday that more than half of the 71 professional forecasters responding to its survey in late August and early September said a recession already has begun or will begin in the fourth quarter of 1990 or the first quarter of 1991. And half of the top economists surveyed each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators now believe the economy will enter a recession this year. ``In a sharp revision of earlier views, 50 percent of the 50 panel members replying ... now think the long-delayed recession will start this year,'' wrote R.J. Eggert, the newsletter's editor. ``Of those expecting the recession to begin this year, three believe it actually began in the second quarter, six expect the downturn to begin in the current quarter and 16 have pegged the fourth quarter of this year as the starting date.'' Sinai pointed to negative economic data already available for July and August and said, ``It looks like the recession started in the third quarter.'' ``The economy ground to a halt in the second quarter and is in the process of contracting right now,'' added Richard W. Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. A price index tied to the GNP was unchanged at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter. But with the surge in oil prices, inflation as measured in the Consumer Price Index jumped 0.8 percent in August alone. The higher prices will be reflected in the third-quarter GNP report. The price of oil before the Iraqi invasion was less than $20 a barrel. It reached a record $38 a barrel at one point on Monday. Since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as for heating and transportation, any price increase not only slashes available funds needed to feed economic growth but also feeds inflation. The department originally had estimated the economy grew at a 1.2 percent rate from April through June, after advances of 1.7 percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent in 1989 and 4.5 percent in 1988. But it said Tuesday that more complete data showed weaker net exports and lower inventory accumulation than first thought. The new data showed net exports declining by $9.2 billion rather than $4.5 billion, and inventories totaling $19.8 billion rather than $22.4 billion. ``But there really were no areas of strength,'' Sinai said. Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, rose just 0.2 percent, down from 1.1 percent in the first quarter. Business investment fell 4.7 percent after a 5 percent gain from January through March. Housing construction plunged 11.2 percent after advancing 15.1 percent in the first quarter. Government spending rose 6.2 percent but most of that was by the federal government. State and local spending was down 0.6 percent. If the economy were in a recession - generally described as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - it would end the nearly eight years of expansion that began after the 1981-82 downturn. The Commerce Department also reported today that after-tax corporate profits fell a revised 0.6 percent, worse than the 0.2 percent drop first reported and their poorest showing since a 5.9 percent decline in the third quarter of 1989. They had risen 0.5 percent in the first quarter and 1.7 percent in the final quarter of 1989. The various changes left the GNP growing by $4.5 billion in the second quarter. After removing the effects of inflation, the GNP totaled an annual rate of $4.16 trillion.", " BUSINESS EDITORS COMPOSING ROOMS The Associated Press will conduct another test transmission from its new market computer system on Sunday beginning at noon Eastern time.

We ask those receiving the transmission to respond Monday by calling the AP in New York at 212-621-1568.", " A U.S. House subcommittee is investigating allegations of attempts to influence senior Internal Revenue Service officials in Washington and six other cities, a panel aide says. ``The allegations of misconduct concern high-level people at district and regional office levels,'' Peter Barash, staff director of the Commerce Consumer and Monetary Affairs subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, told the Lawrenceville-based Gwinnett Daily News on Friday. For seven weeks, subcommittee investigators and the General Accounting Office have been looking into charges of abuse by senior staffers in Los Angeles; Cincinnati; Newark, N.J.; San Francisco; Chicago; and Dallas, as well as Washington, Barash said. The investigators also are trying to determine if top officials at IRS headquarters in Washington failed to act against senior regional officials who allegedly misused their authority, Barash said. Barash said the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., received a number of allegations in the spring about misconduct within the agency. ``We checked out some things and found out that the allegations appear at this preliminary stage of the investigation to be true enough to begin a formal investigation,'' he said. ``It looks like some people, some top IRS senior staffers, were involved in misconduct, abusing of their power for private, personal gain or enrichment.'' Barnard's subcommittee will conduct hearings by early October on the results of its investigation, Barash said. The staff director described one case in Los Angeles involving a senior criminal investigator who went to work for Guess Jeans Inc. after leaving the federal agency. ``The allegation with regards to Guess Jeans is it had an IRS senior employee in Los Angeles under its control and influence and got this employee to either initiate criminal tax fraud investigations (against a competing jeans company) or to kill criminal tax fraud investigations at the behest of Guess Jeans,'' said Barash. The Gwinnett Daily News quoted a spokesman for the jeans maker as saying the company did nothing wrong and has agreed to cooperate with federal investigators.", " BUSINESS EDITORS COMPOSING ROOMS The Associated Press will conduct another test transmission from its new market computer system on SUnday beginning at noon Eastern time.

Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who last year was given additional responsibilities as counselor to Meese, said the bipartisan Senate report is harmful to ongoing inquiries into the attorney general's actions. ``We've got a process that's in place, people who are investigating and it seems to me that we do not contribute to an integrity of that process when we have that kind of report that comes out that so disserves and so misstates what the facts are,'' Reynolds said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program. ``If that is the best case that one comes up with against this attorney general for ethical conduct, I would have to say that this man is as clean as he can possibly be in every respect.'' Reynolds, the top enforcer of the Reagan administration's civil rights policies, added: ``If I were making a list of sleaze, I'd put that (the report) at the top.'' The report, issued Wednesday by the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, concluded that Meese's violation of the rules resulted in ``improper favoritism'' for the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The report said E. Robert Wallach sent Meese, then counselor to President Reagan, 16 memos in 1981 and 1982 detailing Wedtech's efforts to get a contract to build small engines for the Army and government officials' opposition to those efforts. Meese has acknowledged interceding on behalf of Wedtech, but says he only wanted to assure that its contract proposal got a fair hearing. Wallach, a longtime friend of Meese, is now under indictment in the Wedtech scandal. He was paid $1.3 million by the Bronx, N.Y.-company, which subsequently won the no-bid, $32 million contract. ``Former Counselor to the President Edwin Meese III and former Deputy Counselor Jim Jenkins failed to observe the White House policy on contracts with procurement officials, which failure resulted in improper favoritism toward a specific contractor,'' the report said. The White House procurement policy in effect since October 1981 says that ``obviously, no member of the White House staff should contact any procurement officer about a contract in which he has a personal financial interest or in which a relative, friend or business associate has a financial interest.'' Reynolds said the report ``made reference to a policy or rule in the White House that wasn't in existence at the time the Wedtech thing was referred over to the attorney general.'' Independent Counsel James McKay has been investigating Meese's ties to Wedtech, a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project promoted by Wallach, and other matters. In addition, the Office of Government Ethics is conducting an inquiry into why Meese solicited 30,000 lawyers and businessman to pay more than $3,000 apiece to a profit-making organization to attend a conference. Reynolds maintained that despite the investigations, morale at the Justice Department remains good. ``Actually, it's very good,'' he said. ``We have a lot of professionals. Everybody in the department is very professional. ``Most of the people in the department take the attitude that is much the same as George Bush's attitude. These are investigations that are ongoing. They'll play themselves out, the process ought to be allowed to work,'' Reynolds said. ``So far,'' he added, ``nobody has suggested that the attorney general has done anything that comes close to unlawful activity or activity that is going to result in an indictment of any kind.''", " Attorney General Edwin Meese's wife, Ursula, will undergo questioning shortly in the criminal investigation of her husband about her own $40,000-a-year job, say sources familiar with the case. The office of independent counsel James McKay is trying to determine whether longtime Meese friend E. Robert Wallach in effect helped supplement the Meeses' income by recommending Mrs. Meese for jobs, said sources familiar with the probe, speaking on condition of anonymity. Mrs. Meese has retained the same Washington law firm representing her husband, said James Rocap, one of Meese's lawyers. She will either make a federal grand jury appearance or be questioned by investigators from McKay's office. McKay said last week that his investigation of Meese, also encompassing an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Meese's job, would continue at least until the end of April. McKay last month subpoenaed records relating to Mrs. Meese's post with the Washington chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, said a lawyer for the chapter, James Bierbower. A lawyer for Wallach, George Walker, has told The Washington Post that Wallach had suggested Mrs. Meese for a job with a local radio station owned by the Bender family of Washington. Mrs. Meese took the position with the MS Society instead. However, Bierbower said the Bender Foundation of Washington, controlled by the same family that owns the radio station, is contributing the $40,000 a year that constitutes Mrs. Meese's salary with the MS group. Calls to the Bender Foundation seeking its reasons for paying Mrs. Meese's salary were not returned. Mrs. Meese has been a volunteer for the MS Society since 1981 and for the past two years has been in charge of a program called Operation Job Match, matching MS victims with employers. Mrs. Meese also was questioned in an earlier independent counsel's investigation of Meese in 1984. In that investigation, independent counsel Jacob Stein probed Meese's failure to include in his financial disclosure statements a $15,000 loan by Edwin Thomas to Mrs. Meese. Thomas later became Meese's assistant counselor at the White House. The independent counsel found no connection between the loan and federal jobs obtained by Thomas, his wife and his son. In another development Monday, Justice Department sources said Meese will face an ethics investigation by his own department's Office of Professional Responsibility if McKay doesn't seek an indictment. Such an inquiry ultimately could lead to a recommendation to President Reagan that Meese be fired. Former Assistant Attorney General William Weld's files on the attorney general's dealings with Wallach were moved to OPR last Friday, the sources said. Material collected by Weld's criminal division last year led to McKay's criminal investigation of Meese. McKay said Friday he has insufficient evidence to date to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline touted by Wallach or his involvement with the regional Bell telephone companies at a time when he held $14,000 in Baby Bell stock. In December, McKay said he didn't have sufficient evidence at that time to warrant seeking an indictment of Meese in connection with his assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. McKay said that if he decides not to seek a criminal indictment of Meese, the independent counsel's office ``will refer all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate administrative authorities,'' a reference to OPR. OPR's chief, Michael Shaheen, denied assertions by Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, that his office had begun examining Meese's ties to longtime friend Wallach last year. That review was halted when McKay launched his criminal investigation of Meese last May 11, the sources said.", " The Justice Department is evaluating the case against a group of CIA employees who took 86 rare misprinted stamps from their office and sold them for thousands of dollars, a department spokesman said Saturday. Justice Department spokesman Tom Stewart said the agency's public integrity section had received the case and that ``they deal in bringing criminal charges, if necessary.'' ``I would not want you to think that something is imminent,'' he said. The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that the Justice Department was considering bringing criminal charges against the nine CIA employees, who discovered the rare stamps in the agency's supplies and sold them. The Post quoted unidentified intelligence and Justice Department sources as saying the CIA completed an internal review of what stamp collectors call the discovery of ``the CIA invert'' and turned the case over to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. The public integrity section is debating whether to bring charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 $1 stamps bearing an upside-down candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have the rare error, the newspaper said. Each member of the group kept one of the stamps and they sold the 86 remaining stamps in 1986 to a New Jersey dealer for thousands of dollars. Their identities were never made public. A CIA spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday about the case.", " The Agriculture Department wants to hire a new editor for its single-sheet publication, Ag AM, which provides up to two dozen or so news blurbs daily for agency brass. Pay: $33,218 a year to start, with a top of $60,683. So far there have been 41 applicants, including some USDA information specialists who see an opportunity to boost their career prospects. The Ag AM report is issued five days a week, Monday through Friday, except on federal holidays, of course. Mostly it consists of single paragraphs summarizing stories from newspapers, wire services and news magazines. Ed Curran, who retired in 1984 after 20 years working for the department's Office of Information, was privy to the inside workings of Ag AM since it began during the Carter Administration. Now publisher of his own private newsletter, Curran offers a look at the history of the publication and how it grew. Someone in USDA thought the White House practice of providing President Carter with daily news summaries would be good for then-Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland, Curran said in his latest issue. At first the daily summaries were sent only to the secretary and his office staff. But Bergland, who had read the news blurbs, ``began talking about things'' in the news that were not known to senior aides, including the deputy secretary and assistant secretaries. So the press run of Ag AM was increased, and the information office staffer who was responsible for its publication had to begin work earlier, by 6 a.m., for example, instead of the later regular starting time. ``By the time the Reagan administration came upon the scene, Ag AM was a staple at USDA,'' Curran said. Being on the offical list to get one was ``sort of like the government equivalent of a key to the executive washroom.'' The daily press run was increased to 100 copies, to take care of the demand from all the deputy assistant secretaries, administrators of agencies and staff economists. Meanwhile, the bureaucrats in the USDA's information office heard on the grapevine that Agriculture Secretary John R. Block ``was so smitten with Ag AM that he demanded copies to be telexed to him when he was on trips,'' Curran said. However, Block's successor, Richard E. Lyng, ``could care less'' about the news sheet, he added. ``One thing bureaucrats learn early in the game is that when something has the sweet smell of success about it, get behind it with all you've got,'' Curran said. ``So, why not devote more time to Ag AM? Make it a full-time job.'' Curran wryly observed that the information office, meanwhile, scuttled its long-standing weekly Farm Paper Letter, which was ``the department's main contact with the nation's farm magazine editors and farm editors of its daily newspapers.'' Curran named his twice-monthly newsletter the Farm Paper Letter, after the publication he wrote during his 20-year USDA career. Today, 100 copies of Ag AM are delivered to Lyng's office area, alone, Curran said. In all, the press run is 350 copies a day. ``This from an outfit that's vowed to save us money,'' he said. Dave Lane, director of the Office of Information, told The Associated Press it may take some time to select a new full-time Ag AM editor (the previous editor died earlier this year). Was there any consideration given to canceling Ag AM? No, Lane said. Why not? ``I guess because of the ... importance of that publication to inform our top officials,'' he said. ``It's one of the most widely distributed of all the things that we put out.'' Besides the copies distributed within USDA here, the daily news blurbs are now sent electronically to universities, state agriculture departments and other government offices. The report is also available to private users of USDA's electronic information system.", " James Wesley Coldsmith, former editor and publisher of newspapers in Alexandria, Va., died Saturday at his home of leukemia. He was 60. Coldsmith was an editor or publisher of newspapers in the northern Virginia city from the 1960s through the 1980s and ran twice for the city council as a Republican. He expanded an advertising flyer into what became The Journal group of newspapers in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs near Washington. Coldsmith earlier had been editor and publisher of the Alexandria Port Packet and the Alexandria Gazette. Born in Parsons, Kan., Coldsmith worked for The Associated Press in Tokyo, Denver and Chicago, before moving to Virginia in 1966. Earlier, he served in the Army and was news editor of the Stars and Stripes in Tokyo.", " Legislation designed to protect government employees who disclose wrongdoing was approved unanimously by a Senate committee Thursday. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the measure makes it easier for whistleblowers to win a reprisal case and guarantees them the right to a hearing. The bill ``sends a strong message to federal employees that they will not be punished for disclosing government fraud, waste and abuse,'' Levin said. Thursday's approval by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee clears the way for consideration of the bill by the full Senate. Under the bill, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, would have responsibility for protecting employees who disclose wrongdoing. ``Recent statistics show that 70 percent of federal employees claiming knowledge of waste, fraud and abuse fail to report it,'' Levin said. ``These statistics are proof that the current system has failed to convince employees that they will be rewarded instead of punished if they disclose government wrongdoing.''", " After 10 months, one of the many unanswered questions in the criminal investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III is whether he benefited financially from his efforts on behalf of an Iraqi oil pipeline project or scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., sources familiar with the probe say. Last May 11, independent counsel James McKay launched his inquiry of Meese's assistance to Wedtech and the probe has spread to the attorney general's involvement with the pipeline. In both instances, McKay's investigators have been examining stock trades made on Meese's behalf by his investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn. Chinn and Meese were brought together by Meese's longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, a central figure in both the Wedtech scandal and the pipeline project. It was disclosed earlier this month that: _In connection with the $1 billion proposed pipeline, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport paid $150,000 to his attorney Wallach, who directed the funds to an account owned by Chinn. Rappaport was a partner in the project with San Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc., which was going to build the pipeline. Rappaport was brought into the deal in 1985 primarily because of his close ties to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. _The money from the Meese Partners account, Wallach's $150,000 placed in the Chinn account and several hundred thousand dollars from Chinn's biggest customer, Marymount College of Palos Verdes, Calif., were used as capital by Chinn to buy hard-to-get, brand-new stock issues, which Chinn sold later the same day. It would have been difficult for Chinn to obtain such stock with Meese's money alone. ``Without using the holdings of the other accounts he controlled, ... Mr. Chinn may not have been able to conduct the number of trades he did ... on behalf of Meese Partners,'' a congressional subcommittee said in a report this month. _Once the stock was sold and the profit and loss determined, Chinn assigned profits and losses to his various customers. Overall, Meese invested $50,000 and came away 18 months later with $95,000, almost all of it gained through a total of 23 one-day stock trades. Eighteen of the trades were profitable. In seven of the trades, the attorney general didn't have enough money in his account to generate the profits and losses that were assigned him. Chinn's biggest customer, Marymount College, didn't fare nearly as well as Meese. Was the stock trading actually a well-disguised payoff to Meese? That question is one that McKay's office has been unable to resolve, say the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Central to the criminal investigation is whether there was a plan to steer the proceeds of Chinn's stock transactions to Meese and whether the attorney general knew about it. The attorney general says he knew nothing about the transactions because he had set up a limited blind partnership with Chinn's company under which details were to be kept secret from Meese as a way to protect the attorney general from violating rules against conflict of interest. The investigators face a wall of silence from the others involved in setting up the financial arrangements, Chinn and Wallach, who are both under indictment for racketeering in the Wedtech scandal. Wallach denied to McKay's investigators that he gave anything of value to Meese, but Wallach refused to tell McKay anything about his dealings with Wedtech, his knowledge of the Meese-Chinn partnership and his dealings with Chinn. McKay said that after the Wedtech trial expected later this year of Wallach, Chinn and business associate R. Kent London, the independent counsel may seek their testimony again. The attorney general's good fortune in stock trading began months after he smoothed the way for Wallach to discuss the pipeline with then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, who met with Wallach and Rappaport in June 1985. Later in the year, Meese and Wallach met with Peres about the pipeline, which was never built. Also during the period the stock trading was taking place, Chinn sat on the board of directors of Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor that allegedly paid out millions of dollars to lawyers and lobbyists in an attempt to influence various public officials, including Meese, in the awarding of federal contracts. One of those lawyers was Wallach, who was paid $1.3 million from 1981 through 1986 by Wedtech. The stock trades that made profits for the attorney general took place some four years after Meese, then White House counselor, arranged for his deputy, James Jenkins, to intervene on behalf of Wedtech in connection with a $32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. Despite the misgivings of Army officials over what they regarded as a high price, Wedtech was awarded the contract following a White House meeting called by Jenkins. Meese ended the financial arrangement with Chinn last year after the investment adviser came under criminal investigation in the Wedtech scandal and after public disclosure that Chinn had sat on Wedtech's board of directors.", " Florida investor Paul Bilzerian has acquired 2 million shares of the Hadson Corp. as part of Hadson's agreement to purchase HRB Holdings Inc., a Singer Co. division, company officials said Monday. Stephen Houghton, president and chief executive officer of the Hadson Corp., said an agreement for the purchase of HRB Holdings Inc. from Bilzerian was announced in February and a final agreement was completed earlier this month. He said Hadson acquired the company for $137 million in cash and 2 million shares of common stock. Houghton said Bilzerian's acquisition of the stock was for investment purposes only. Bilzerian took Singer private earlier this year and has been selling off a number of its assets.", " Santa Fe Pacific Corp. has announced it will split into three independent entities on Dec. 4. in a move it says will benefit shareholders. The railroad, energy and real-estate conglomerate said Monday that its board of directors approved a previously announced plan to spin off Santa Fe Energy Resources and Catellus Development Corp., formerly Santa Fe Pacific Realty, to shareholders. Santa Fe stockholders of record as of Nov. 29 will receive a special, tax-free dividend consisting of one share of common stock of Santa Fe Energy Resources for every 3.3 shares of Santa Fe Pacific held, and one share of Catellus for every 4 shares of Santa Fe Pacific. Distributions of fractional shares will be settled in cash. The spinoffs will leave the Chicago-based parent company with three interests: the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and a 44 percent stake in Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines. Santa Fe announced in April its plan to spin off the Houston-based energy and San Francisco-based real-estate units as part of a far-reaching restructuring program begun in 1987. Chairman Robert Krebs said in a statement that the values of Santa Fe's diversified assets have not been reflected in Santa Fe's stock price. Santa Fe Pacific stock closed 25 cents lower at $13 a share Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. ``Our stockholders should benefit from this separation because it will place a spotlight on the values inherent in those companies,'' he said. ``In addition, the directors, management and employees of all three companies will now be able to focus their energies on better utilizing and developing their assets,'' he said. Santa Fe previously sold 18.3 percent of Santa Fe Energy Resources to the public. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Santa Fe also has sold a 20 percent stake in the real-estate subsidiary to a limited partnership formed by JMB Realty Corp. and the California Public Employees Retirement System. Santa Fe said Catellus has been approved for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", " A General Motors Corp. subsidiary will buy an insurance holding company subsidiary of Xerox Financial Services for an undisclosed sum, the companies said Friday. Motors Insurance Corp., a subsidiary of GM's General Motors Acceptance Corp. unit, will acquire NAVCO Corp., a subsidiary of Xerox's Crum and Forster Inc. organization, the companies said. The deal faces regulatory approval and a vote from each company's board. NAVCO provides automobile insurance mainly to members of associations. It had annual premiums of about $147 million last year. Motors Insurance had revenues of $1.1 billion in 1989 and insures personal and commercial coverages and plans. Crum and Forster, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., also said it wants to sell its Viking Insurance Co. of Wisconsin.

Maxwell and Societe Generale agreed in June to cooperate in creating a joint venture in communications, and the two sides had broached the possibility of Maxwell acquiring shares in Societe Generale. But the negotiations were interrupted when Maxwell turned his attention to Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publishing and information services company he has offered to acquire for $2.47 billion in cash. This week Macmillan agreed to a $2.5 billion cash-and-securities buyout by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., but Maxwell said he was mulling his options. On Wednesday, Maxwell said he remained interested in acquiring a stake in Societe Generale and that talks may resume soon. A spokesman for Societe Generale said, ``We continue to be interested in having more international shareholders.'' Maxwell appears primarily drawn to Societe Generale's media interests, which are concentrated in Tractebel SA.", " James R. Mellor was elected Wednesday as president and chief operating officer of General Dynamics Corp., effective Jan. 1. Mellor, 60, is executive vice president of marine, land systems and international at General Dynamics corporate offices in St. Louis. He will succeed President and CEO Herbert F. Rogers, 65, who will continue on special assignment as general manager of the company's Fort Worth Division. Rogers will become vice chairman on Jan. 1. William A. Anders, General Dynamics' vice chairman, will succeed Stanley Pace as chairman and CEO when Pace retires at the end of the year.

Molson Cos. Ltd., a diversified Canadian company, also said Monday that it did not have any interest in acquiring Payless after examining public information about the company. Sanjib Choudhuri, senior vice president of corporate development and planning, declined to say why his company lost interest. Senior management of Payless has offered $27 a share to take the company private. The offer was made to thwart an unfriendly takeover attempt by New York investor Asher Edelman and Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., a competitor of Payless. The offer by Payless management is worth $909 million. Bick said Ward White was approached by an investment banking firm two or three weeks ago about Payless. He said Ward White agreed to request information about Payless because a takeover seemed worth considering, but Ward White's interest was never great. ``We no longer need nor want the information,'' Bick said. Ward White owns the third-largest building materials retailing chain in the United Kingdom. The Edelman-Sutherland group is Payless' largest shareholder with 8.1 percent of the stock. It had said for weeks that it is interested in acquiring Payless, but has not made a formal offer. The offer from Payless management requires the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders, who have until 3 to respond. Payless has 200 stores in 26 states.", " Former Fruehauf Corp. chief execitve Neal Combs, who ran the company when it was dismantled to meet leveraged buyout debts, has been replaced as head of its truck-trailer operation. Combs was replaced Tuesday as Fruehauf Trailer Corp.'s chief executive by Terex Corp. President Woodward Baldus, officials said. Green Bay, Wis.-based Terex bought Fruehauf's trailer business last August as Fruehauf assets were sold off to meet debts from a $1.5-billion leveraged buyout by management. Fruehauf Trailer Corp. continues as a Terex subsidiary. Combs went to Terex with the trailer business. Combs could not be reached for comment Wednesday at Fruehauf or at his home. ``Combs was asked to resign,'' Terex spokesman Jeff Zilka said, but declined further comment. The last of the former Fruehauf's assets, Kelsey-Hayes Co., maker of auto parts such as aluminum wheels and anti-lock braking systems, was sold to Canada's Varity Corp. last November. Fruehauf Trailer employs about 5,100 people in its U.S. operations.", " Air Wis Services Inc. rejected as inadequate a $121 million takeover bid from a Connecticut investment firm, but left the door open for a higher offer. The offer of $16.365 a share from Cove Capital Associates Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., is the fourth takeover bid for the airline holding company since last November. Cove represents Transmark USA Inc., an insurance holding company based in Jacksonville, Fla. The offer rejected Wednesday includes $14 a share in cash and $2.36{ in preferred stock. The Air Wis board of directors said it would reconsider its stance if a higher, all-cash offer were made. Air Wis officials questioned how much cash Cove and Transmark could bring to the table without borrowing against assets of Air Wis, whose Air Wisconsin subsidiary operates United Express airline. ``Your proposal to utilize a form of preferred stock to finance a significant part of your acquisition costs suggests to our board that Cove Capital and Transmark USA may not have sufficient resources to effect an acquisition of the company at a reasonable price without borrowing significantly against the company's assets,'' Air Wis President Preston Wilbourne told Cove. Wilbourne said an acquisition that involved heavy borrowing could impair Air Wis' plans to expand and to acquire new equipment, bring route cutbacks and cause defaults on existing financial agreements. Last November, a group headed by Citicorp Venture Capital and two former executives of United Airlines offered $11.50 a share for Air Wis. That was followed by a bid from former Air Wis chairman Arthur Hailand and John J. Louis Jr., a director, for $14 a share. Hailand and Louis later raised their bid to $17 a share, comprised of $14 in cash and $3 in debt. All three bids were rejected by the Air Wis board. Hailand was removed as chairman when the board turned down his first offer.", " Kraft Inc. said Thursday it was selling its fast-growing Duracell battery division to a group led by management and the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in a cash deal worth $1.8 billion. Kraft said it agreed to sell Duracell Inc., the world's leading maker of alkaline consumer batteries, to concentrate on its core food business. Proceeds from the sale would be used to buy back up to 12 million Kraft shares, to reduce debt and for possible food-related acquisition, the company said. ``... We are excited about the many opportunities available to Kraft in the food industry, and the sale of Duracell will enable us to focus our total management and financial resources on those opportunities,'' said Kraft Chairman John M. Richman. Kraft informed its shareholders of the definitive agreement at its annual meeting Thursday in Chicago. Kraft, which acquired Bethel, Conn.-based Duracell in 1980, had announced in December that it planned to sell the unit. Henry R. Kravis, a partner in New York-based Kohlberg Kravis, called the agreement ``the first step in the creation of a great new independent consumer-products company.'' ``We are very excited about the future growth prospects of the company and our future association with the management and employees of Duracell,'' he said. Some analysts expressed surprise at the price Kohlberg Kravis agreed to pay for Duracell, which had been widely expected to fetch between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. ``It never ceases to amaze me what a good brand is worth in today's marketplace,'' said John W. McMillin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``This was pleasant news for Kraft shareholders.'' In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kraft rose $1.50 a share to close at $53.50. McMillin said Kohlberg Kravis probably was attracted by Duracell's strong growth potential. Duracell, which has about 9,000 employees, had an operating income of $140 million and sales of $1.1 billion last year. Kraft's 1987 sales, excluding Duracell, were $9.9 billion. Duracell's copper-top alkaline batteries account for about 28 percent of all U.S. consumer battery sales. The company is tied with Ralston Purina Co.'s Eveready unit for the lead in domestic sales of alkaline batteries, the fastest-growing segment of the battery market. Together, Eveready and Duracell have more than 80 percent of the domestic alkaline-battery market, McMillin said. Duracell does not compete in the carbon-zinc battery market, which is dominated by Eveready. ``With all these Walkmans and portable tape recorders that have to use batteries, the alkaline segment has been exhibiting strong volume growth and that is what had to attract these investors,'' McMillin said. Analysts said they did not expect Duracell to diversify as a stand-alone company. ``It could happen in time, but certainly not immediately,'' said Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``When you do a leveraged buyout you've got to use the cash generated internally to reduce debt, so you've got to pretty much stick to your own business.'' Duracell is being sold to Duracell Holdings Corp., the new company formed by Kohlberg Kravis and Duracell's management. Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts, in which a company is acquired mainly through borrowed funds repaid from the target company's profits or asset sales.", " Here is a state-by-state listing of per capita incomes for 1987, followed by each state's ranking by income level and the percentage change from 1986.

As of July 1, minority couples in cities of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be limited to two children, and those in rural areas will be permitted three, the Xinhua News Agency said. Minority ethnic groups in Xinjiang total 8.6 million, or more than 61 percent of the population, the report said. Most Hans or ethnic Chinese, who make up more than 90 percent of China's 1 billion people, are limited to one child with the country struggling to feed and educate its spiraling population. However, the policy has been more relaxed toward China's 56 ethnic minority groups. The different standard toward minorities has been designed in part to win their loyalty to the Han-controlled government and allay their fears of being overwhelmed by ethnic Chinese.", " Federal fuel-economy standards will cause thousands of traffic deaths next year by discouraging the use of safer, larger cars, two researchers said Tuesday as the government reported a slight increase in auto fuel efficiency last year. ``Fuel economy regulation inevitably leads to smaller, lighter cars that are inherently less safe than the cars that would be produced without a binding fuel-economy constraint,'' said a study by Robert W. Crandall of the Brookings Institution in Washington and John D. Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. They estimated the standards would cause 2,200 to 3,900 traffic deaths next year. Also Tuesday, the Transportation Department told Congress that passenger cars sold in the United States got 28.2 miles per gallon last year overall, up 0.2 miles per gallon from the previous year. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said Americans tended to buy slightly heavier, higher performance cars last year than in prior years, and imports showed a shift way from subcompacts to compacts, increasing their market share by 8 percentage points. Among the Big Three automakers, Chrysler Corp. had the most fuel efficient cars fleetwide in 1987, at 27.6 mpg, down from 27.8 mpg in 1986. Ford Motor Co. had a fuel-economy of 26.8 mpg, unchanged from the previous year, and General Motors Corp.'s was 26.4 mpg, up from 26.2 mpg the previous year. Weighted by sales, imports had an fuel economy of 31 mpg, down from 31.7 mpg the previous year. Domestic cars averaged 26.7 mpg, up from 26.6 mpg the year before. Burnley used the report to reiterate his support for elimination of the fuel-economy requirement, saying it placed U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition. ``The greatest contribution we can make to keeping jobs in the United States and to making the domestic auto industry competitive on a worldwide basis is to repeal the (fuel economy) rules,'' Burnley said. ``Thousands of American jobs are threatened because of an anachronistic law that is doing substantial harm to our economy and our trade balance.'' The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards _ CAFE for short _ from 1978 sought to encourage more fuel efficient cars and thereby reduce petroleum use at a time of shortages and soaring prices. The required fuel economy this year is 26 mpg of gasoline. Manufacturers that fail to meet the standards are liable to fines. Using mathematical models, Crandall and Graham estimated the CAFE standards had reduced the weight of cars by 500 pounds, to 3,100 pounds, despite sharp declines in oil prices after 1981 that in an unregulated market would be expected to encourage manufacture of larger cars. That decline in weight ``caused by CAFE is associated with a 14 to 27 percent increase in occupant fatality risk,'' the study said. They applied that range to existing traffic fatality figures to make their estimate of the number of additional deaths likely in 1989. The estimate took into account such factors as the tendency of occupants of smaller cars, compared with those of larger cars, to buckle their safety belts, the study said. The study also said the CAFE standards, by raising the cost of desirable high-performance cars, have encouraged people to drive their cars longer, extending ``the useful life of older, less safe and higher-pollution cars.'' Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., said at a news conference marking the study's release he hopes the conclusions will help win support for legislation he introduced last year to abolish the CAFE standards. ``Congress is not the place to design auto models,'' Carr said, acknowledging the bill's chances of passage this year are slim. The study by Crandall and Graham is scheduled for publication next year in The Journal of Law and Economics. The study was released by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a public-issues group espousng free-market principles. Crandall and Graham said they did the study without funds from the institute.", " This year's college graduates received higher salary offers than last year's graduates, especially in business fields, but the number of job offers declined slightly, according to a survey released Sunday. The largest increase was in accounting, with graduates receiving salary offers 10.9 percent higher than last year. The average monthly offer rose from $1,812 to $2,010, for an average yearly salary of $24,120. Job offers in accounting were down slightly from 5,478 to 5,264, according to a College Placement Council survey released Sunday. The data included offers made to students graduating between Sept. 1, 1987, and Aug. 31, 1988. Placement offices at 154 colleges and universities participated in the survey. Acceptances were not reported because August graduations were included. In business administration, the average salary offer rose 4.1 percent from $1,701 to $1,772, or $21,264 a year, but offers fell from 1,788 to 1,285, the survey said. In banking, salary offers dropped 3.9 percent from $1,889 to $1,815, or $21,780 a year, but the number of jobs increased from 395 to 527. Non-technical graduates received 48 percent of the job offers made to graduates with bachelor's degrees, while technical graduates received 52 percent of the offers. For non-technical graduates, 40 percent of the job offers came from public accounting employers, while the electrical and electronic machinery and equipment industry provided 16 percent of the job offers to technical graduates. The average monthly salary offered to non-technical graduates was $2,045, or $24,540 a year, according to the survey. Technical graduates averaged monthly offers of $2,465, or $29,580. For master's of business administration candidates with non-technical undergraduate degrees, starting offers increased 5 percent to $2,791, or $33,492 annually. Inexperienced MBA candidates with technical undergraduate degrees attracted offers of $3,192, or $38,304, an 11.8 percent rise. Technical and non-technical MBA graduates with previous experience garnered increased salary offers between 4 percent and 16 percent, the survey said. The engineering field provided 42 percent of the job offers to graduates with bachelor's degrees and was followed by business with 40 percent, sciences at 10 percent, humanities and social sciences at 6 percent and communications at 2 percent. However, for master's degree candidates, business disciplines made 52 percent of the offers; engineering, 36 percent; sciences, 8 percent; and humanities and social sciences, 4 percent. The survey reported men received slightly higher salary offers in business administration, marketing and distribution, economics and several science disciplines. Women received slightly higher offers in engineering.", " Amid the frozen farm fields of Iowa, Judy Shelly answered a cry for help from a small wooden garage. Huddled inside were a mother and three children. They'd lost almost everything _ including their home. They had blankets, beds, a few sticks of furniture and a hot plate, but no bathroom or refrigerator. No money either. Forced off their farm, abandoned by husband and father, the family was struggling to survive. Their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard times in the heartland. As farmers lose their land, small-town factories shut their doors and housing costs rise, growing numbers of rural folks are joining the ranks of the nation's homeless. ``Rural homeless people are everywhere around us,'' said Louisa Stark, president of the National Coalition for the Homeless. ``They're living in barns and chicken coops. They're doubled and tripled up with families and friends. They're living under trees or, in some cases, sleeping in caves.'' Garages, too. The Iowa family had rented a nearby house after losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the landlord couldn't afford repairs, they moved into the garage because it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater. Shelly, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after. People think rural America ``has been able to stand on its own two feet ever since the Depression,'' Shelly said. ``(They think) somehow they'll get by. They think you have the white picket fence, mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That's not the way it is. ``The reality is urban life and rural life are not much different anymore,'' she added. ``We have people going without food. We have people going without heat.'' And people going without roofs over their heads. Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in rural areas, but nobody knows for sure because they aren't as conspicious as people panhandling on city streets or sleeping on grates. ``Everybody calls the rural homeless invisible. In fact, they are,'' said Melanie Roth of the Housing Assistance Council in Washington, D.C., which deals with rural low-income housing needs. ``They don't wander the streets of small-town America,'' said Keith Luebke, co-director of the Welcome Inn Transitional Living Center in Mankato, Minn. ``They leave or they somehow hide themselves or hide their problems. They don't want anyone to know.'' Most of the newest rural homeless are working poor and farm families, says a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. Compared with their urban counterparts, the report says, they're younger families dependent on two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the remaining income isn't enough to pay the rent. They most often live in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled industries. These people face a Hobson's choice of moving in with friends or relatives _ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute's report said some rural areas have a five-year waiting list for public housing. Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities, the rural homeless get much less help _ fewer shelters, fewer soup kitchens, less money from charities. ``In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the homeless in urban America has been denied the homeless of rural America,'' said a national coalition study on such problems in Appalachia and the South. Several studies have examined rural homelessness. Among the findings: _ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a Housing Assistance Council survey last year reported increases in rural homeless from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said the increase was significant. _ In Ohio, the proportion of women among the rural homeless was twice that of urban homeless populations, according to a 1985 study. That's partly due to the higher percentage of married people among the rural homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among urban homeless. _ In Minnesota, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional living centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in urban Minneapolis, said a 1988 study by the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless. _ In Iowa, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of losing homes was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few hundred dollars a month. The count of rural homeless should also include people who live in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be 21 people living in one house, nine children and three adults squeezed in a trailer or a family so crowded they sleep in shifts. ``You have people living on top of each other. Those are the hidden homeless,'' said Luebke. ``These people no longer have their own home or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real terms they should be considered homeless.'' Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies say it's tantamount to being homeless. ``When people have a home where the roof is constantly leaking and the cold air can come in ... (and) there's no money to fix those things, that's not a home,'' said Norma Dell, director of Bethany House, a Kentucky social service center. Agencies around the country have files on people living in rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound man living under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian family sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough, a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator. Stark said she's heard reports from California of farmworkers living in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves.", " A rogue computer program that steals electronic documents and covers its own tracks has invaded dozens of computers in a nationwide computer network, a published report said. The program has infiltrated the computers of corporations, non-classified military installations, government laboratories and several universities, The New York Times reported in today's editions. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Digital Equipment Corporation, Harvard University, Boston University and the University of Texas are among the affected institutions, unidentified investigators told the Times. The computer network is Internet, a worldwide collection of computer systems that links corporations, government projects and universities together. Government computer security teams have been unable to trace the source of the illegal program. Their job has been especially difficult because the program automatically erases computer files that would help them trace break-ins, the newspaper said. No classified military computers have been affected and damage has been slight to the Internet system, unidentified government officials told the newspaper. The computer attack is being run through a single hidden location. But in order to avoid detection, the hacker is connecting to Internet through a series of computers. The program is designed to find a file containing the system's passwords and copy the file into another computer for decoding. Some of the break-ins were traced to Texas and New Mexico before investigators lost the trail. Internet was thrown into chaos in November 1988 when a program written by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University, jammed the system. The new program is not the same as one that Morris used. That program, called a worm, copied itself from computer to computer, as a computer virus does. ``The computer virus frenzy is not the real problem,'' said Peter Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI International, a research center in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The real problem is the fact that the computers are so vulnerable, and whether the attack is by one person at a computer or a program like a worm or virus, they're all exploiting the same problem _ the vulnerability of our computer systems.''", " The hotel and motel industry is a growing industry in need of help. ``There are simply not enough people to meet the requirements of a constantly expanding industry,'' says Roger Saunders, president of the American Hotel and Motel Association. ``Young people will find abundant openings as never before, in administration, computer technology, food and beverage, sales, room management, housekeeping, accounting _ you name it,'' says Saunders, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of the Saunders Hotels Co., Boston. Saunders says the travel business is now the nation's second biggest employer and ``in just 10 years, by the turn of the century, travel will be the nation's No. 1 employer, with one out of every seven people in the work force.'' He advises young people considering a career to look into hotel schools to prepare for the business. But it is not a career only for young people, he says. ``There are excellent income potentials for students and mothers of young children, or women whose children are grown. The same is true for senior citizens who want to work _ whether 50, 60 or over 70. They are reliable, dependable workers and serve as role models for young people. ``The same is true for the handicapped who can and want to work.''", " A government advisory committee Friday unveiled a series of measures to bring down soaring land prices, including promoting the relocation of government offices outside of Tokyo and more underground and high-rise construction. A government report in April said land prices skyrocketed last year, with the most expensive real estate in central Tokyo valued at 34 million yen, or $272,000, per square meter, or more than $6.7 billion an acre. The medium- and long-term recommendations also include tax reform to encourage development of farmland within cities for housing and the use of taxes on idle land to promote construction of leisure facilities, said Tadashi Miyagawa of the Management and Coordination Agency. The panel is expected to present its plan to the new administrative reform committee on May 30 for further study. A final report will be presented to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in mid-June, Miyagawa said. The government is expected to decide soon after which measures it will take to bring down inflated land prices, he said. Politicians and consumer groups have called the land price problem the most urgent in Japanese society. Most young people have given up hopes of owning their own home.", " The European Economic Community recommended that its 12 member governments authorize individuals to make their own electricity and buy up all excess energy from private sources. The EEC's executive Commission said Thursday that private production of electricity is being discouraged or even banned throughout the trading bloc by legislation that presents ``insurmountable obstacles to self-generation'' of electricity by users. The Commission, in a formal recommendation, said the member governments should allow self-production and obligate utility companies to buy surplus energy at fair prices. Such a system, it said, would help stimulate the development of alternative sources of energy and lead to better use of available resources.", " Frustration over having to draw up an unemotional report on the homeless and then go into streets where people were ``ravaging garbage cans'' prompted dissent by most of the report's authors, one of them said today. Phyllis Wolfe, executive director of a private health care program for the homeless in the nation's capital, said that while gathering information for the report, panel members became outraged at conditions they found. ``It could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and figures,'' Ms. Wolfe said on ``CBS This Morning.'' Ms. Wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine in issuing a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in its report published Monday. The published report, ``Homelessness, Health and Human Needs,'' calls the growing number of homeless children ``a national disgrace.'' It recommends such measures as changing food stamp programs, increasing Medicaid services and expanding programs that help pre-school children. The authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations in the report were too limited. They said the country should supply more low-income housing, raise the minimum wage, offer more support services and guarantee homeless people adequate health care. Nine members of the 13-member panel signed the supplementary statement saying the main study ``fails to capture our sense of shame and anger about homelessness.'' The original report estimates that families with a total of 100,000 children are homeless on any given night, in addition to countless children who have run away from home or been kicked out by their parents. It says those under 18 are the fastest growing homeless group, and homelessness is increasing in many rural areas as well as in the nation's cities. Ms. Wolfe said the committee's work on the report was ``very structured,'' but members found themselves ``leaving committee meetings and walking by and seeing people ravaging garbage cans, seeing people suffering on the street.'' The supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment: ``We have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then, walking home, passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced people energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents' income from aluminum cans,'' it says. ``We analyzed mortality data for the homeless but lacked any platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic services.'' ``We can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly homeless dying of hypothermia, to the children with blighted futures poisoned by lead in rat-infested dilapidated welfare hotels, to women raped, to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions, and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such as AIDS,'' the supplementary report said. It said the committee members who dissented against the report's limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations, but ``felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the most basic recommendation: homelessness in the United States is an inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated.''", " Pronunciations of the names of some leading Yugoslav politicans: Slobodan Milosevic (Sloh-BOH-don Me-LOSH-veech), Serbian president.

In Budapest, the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats won a plurality of votes in the first round of municipal elections Sept. 30 and was leading in Sunday's second round. The liberal Free Democrats led with 36 percent of the vote in Budapest, with about 17 percent of the ballots counted, state-run television reported. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the strongest force in Parliament, had about 25 percent. The results in Budapest and other urban centers are seen as a test for the center-right coalition government of Jozsef Antall, six months after national elections. Runoffs were held in communities with below 40 percent turnout in the first round of municipal elections. The first-round turnout was 34 percent in Budapest. In the runoffs, a simple majority will decide the vote. Complete results in Budapests and results elsewhere were not expected until Monday. According to state radio, turnout Sunday ranged from 20 percent in some rural areas to about 32 percent of Budapest's 1.5 million eligible voters.", " Opposition leaders and Communist officials have tentatively set national elections for June, government television reported. ``According to unofficial information, the first round of (parliamentary) elections should take place on June 8,'' Czechoslovak TV said Thursday. The report came as the Communists, other political parties and the opposition Civic Forum met to review procedures for the elections and the status of independent political parties. ``The draft elections law is aimed at having the elections for the Federal Assembly and both National Councils (parliament) first ... and in the second half of the year the elections to the lower levels of representative bodies should take place,'' the television said. The 35O-member Czechoslovak Parliament is so far dominated by Communists. The discussions are expected to produce a solution to balancing its membership to reflect the current political situation. The talks are being attended by all five political parties existing before the revolution and the loosely organized opposition group, Civic Forum. About 20 new political parties have been created in Czechoslovakia the past two months, but none is represented at the current talks. The peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia led to the ouster of Communist party chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line colleagues in late November. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became president last month.", " Neil Kinnock, leader of Britain's opposition Labor Party, will be challenged for the post by veteran leftist Tony Benn at the party conference in the fall, a Labor coalition said Wednesday. The Campaign Group, composed of about 40 leftist party lawmakers, said Kinnock's deputy, moderate Roy Hattersley, will be challenged by leftist Eric Heffer. The announcement came after a meeting of the party's national executive committee. Kinnock, 46, and Hattersley are considered not as left wing as Benn and Heffer. Benn, 62, a former Cabinet minister, has accused Kinnock of watering down socialism after the party's three defeats in nine years by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock and Hattersley have worked for a united party and cracked down on militants in hopes of making a broader appeal to voters. They say a leadership contest will distract the party from opposing the government. Kinnock and Hattersley denounced the challenge in a joint statement as ``futile and selfish'' and predicted ``massive defeat'' for Benn and Heffer. Benn told reporters: ``Democracy is about choice.'' Heffer said: ``The time has come for a crusade for socialism. The working people of this country are getting a worse and worse deal.''", " Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, head of Sweden's caretaker Cabinet, is ready to lead a new government to replace the one which resigned last week, the national news agency TT reported Thursday. Earlier Thursday, the Social Democratic leader informed Parliament Speaker Thage G. Peterson he was ready and able to present the government to the legislature for approval. He was expected to get active support from the small Communist Party and passive support for the comeback by the middle-of-the-road Center Party. His previous government resigned on Feb. 15 when the Communists joined other opposition parties to defeat a bill for a two-year wage and price freeze.", " Mikhail S. Gorbachev has won another political victory, gaining Communist Party approval to restructure the Politburo that once ruled the country. The Politburo now promises to play second fiddle to the separate government structure he also leads. The vote by the 28th Communist Party Congress on Monday also marks a new effort to reduce the ethnic unrest that is tearing the Soviet Union apart by including party leaders from the 15 Soviet republics on the Politburo, the party's ruling inner circle. The new body will have up to 23 members, nearly twice the 12 voting members on the old body, and many if not most of the faces should be new. The expansion and restructuring will accelerate the process that Gorbachev began after he was elected to a strengthened presidency in March, transferring power to a newly created Presidential Council _ a development that has angered such hard-line Politburo members as Yegor K. Ligachev and could squeeze them out of their jobs. Unlike the Politburo, whose members are elected by the party, members of the Presidential Council are appointed and dismissed by the president, along the lines of a Western-style cabinet. The Politburo, which formerly met once every Thursday, has been meeting only once a month since March, and has been concentrating on Communist Party rather than government issues. Since most of the Politburo members will reside in their home republics, the Politburo will continue to meet relatively infrequently and will not exercise as tight control over national affairs as the body has traditionally done. The duties of the government council have not been fully defined. The 16-man body consists of six voting members of the Politburo, including the prime minister, defense minister, foreign minister, the KGB chief, and Gorbachev's right-hand man, Alexander Yakovlev. Other members are the chief law enforcement official, a reform-minded economist, a crusading environmentalist and a workers' rights activist. Significantly, whereas nine of 12 men on the old Politburo were members of the ethnic Russian majority, the new Politburo will include a majority of non-Russians. And the Presidential Council contains five non-Russians. The new Politburo will include the heads of the party organizations in the 15 republics, most of whom are clamoring for greater control over political and economic decisions affecting their regions. Shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist Party five years ago, Gorbachev sought to centralize his authority, but he has been driven to support greater regional autonomy by the independence drives of the three Baltic republics. Moreover, the largest Soviet republic, the Russian Federation, last month proclaimed its intent to seek greater control of its affairs under the leadership of its populist Communist president, Boris N. Yeltsin. Mostly recently, Gorbachev has embraced the idea of reconstituting the Soviet Union as a looser confederation of republics. The Politburo has had its ups and downs since it was created on the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that swept the Communists to power. The first two Soviet leaders, Vladimir I. Lenin and Josef V. Stalin, exercised virtual one man rule, appointing aides and allies to the Politburo. Under Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled for 18 years until his death in 1982, the Politburo was a coalition that made all the key decisions. As Brezhnev and the other Politburo members weakened with age, the country lapsed into what Gorbachev has labeled the period of stagnation. The first Politburo consisted of seven Bolsheviks, among them Lenin, the founder of the Red Army Leon Trotsky, and the lesser-known Stalin. Following Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin eliminated Trotsky and other rivals from the ruling body. By the height of his power in 1952, he had expanded the membership to 25 voting members, all loyal aides. It also included 11 non-voting members. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who rose to power after Stalin's death in 1953, whittled the body to 15 voting and nine non-voting members. Although he instituted reforms, he tried to keep a tight personal grip on power, angering Politburo colleagues who tried unsuccessfully to oust him in 1957 and succeeded in 1964. Brezhnev, Khrushchev's successor, used the Politburo to forge a coalition among Soviet interest groups, such as the armed forces, the KGB, other government ministries and major industrial sectors, who held most of the dozen slots. He also included seven heads of republic parties as non-voting Politburo members, allowing them to run their regions in return for loyalty. Gorbachev and his allies argue that Brezhnev's system led to widescale corruption and blocked the transformation of the country into a modern industrial society.", " PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Radio stations on Thursday announced the contents of a draft decree proposed by Haiti's military rulers, which says a government-appointed Electoral College will run elections and write an electoral law. The draft decree said the Electoral Board, made up of nine government-appointed representatives, one from each of Haiti's provinces, will also control voter registration and arbitrate disputes between candidates, Radio Haiti Inter said. The decree bears the names of Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril and all 12 Cabinet ministers, the station said. ``The draft project is quite simply anti-constitutional; a scheme to get around the constitution,'' said Dr. Louis Roy, co-author of the constitution massively approved by Haitians in a 1987 referendum. The 1987 constitution, considered the most liberal in Haiti's 184-year history, provides for an independent electoral council, appointed by institutions such as the Roman Catholic Church, human rights groups and journalists associations. ``It is not possible to restore the constitution by anti-constitutional means. In Avril's version of the electoral institution, the executive names the members, and deprives it thereby of its independence,'' Roy said. After he was appointed president by soldiers who ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17, Avril promised to respect the constitution, human rights, and return Haiti to democracy. Avril told opposition politicians that elections could not be held for at least another two years. The government delivered copies of the draft decree to several radio stations, political parties and professional groups in Port-au-Prince, asking for comments and suggestions, which may be incorporated into the decree before it is made into law by the military government, Radio Haiti Inter said. Namphy had suspended the constitution, saying it was inspired by foreign ideas. Soldiers said they ousted Namphy because they were sickened by unpunished acts of terrorism and state-sponsored violence. Namphy abolished the independent Electoral Council on Nov. 29 hours after thugs protected by soldiers shot and hacked to death at least 36 voters, in what would have been Haiti's first truly free election. An attempt by Namphy to override the independent council and rewrite the electoral law in June 1987 touched off a wave of anti-government protests and strikes, which left over 30 dead and dozens wounded. Namphy replaced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to France in February 1986.", " A bomb exploded Saturday near a polling booth in Dhaka, killing one person and wounding three as Bangladeshis cast ballots in nine districts where voting had been postponed because of earlier violence. Police said Borhanuddin Ahmed, 25, was killed in the explosion in downtown Dhaka. At least 13 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in violence during the parliamentary elections held on March 3, and the government stopped and rescheduled the voting in 125 districts. Elections were held in nine districts Saturday, but no results were reported. The major opposition parties boycotted the elections. President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's Jatiya Party won 245 seats in the 300-member parliament in the March 3 balloting, according to results announced by the government. It said a coalition of 73 smaller groups and parties won 15 seats and independent candidates won 15. Ershad's party plans to celebrate its victory with prayer meetings on March 16. Opposition parties have called for protest rallies on March 24, the sixth anniversary of the bloodless coup that brought Gen. Ershad to power. Leading the opposition campaign are Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia who have demanded that Ershad resign.", " A couple accused of taking a premature baby from a hospital were arrested after they showed off the infant to relatives who became suspicious and called police, authorities said. Sharon and Robert Newkirk were arrested Saturday on charges of kidnapping 2{-month-old Debra Lynn Moore on Friday evening from her crib at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor. They were to be arraigned later today. The Newkirks on Friday took a child to the home of Robert Newkirk's sister and brother-in-law, Judy and Gerald Edmundson. ``Robert was so excited,'' Judy Edmundson said. ``He held her and said, `Daddy loves you.''' But in retrospect, ``We had a funny feeling about it,'' Gerald Edmundson said. ``The next day, we heard the report on the news that a baby had been kidnapped. We put two and two together.'' Police picked up the Newkirks as they pulled into the driveway of their home in Howell, about 20 miles away. Police said they found the baby in the couple's car. The baby was returned to C.S. Mott, where her twin brother also is a patient, and was listed in good condition. Police Sgt. Jim Tieman said authorities did not know a motive for the abduction.", " The violin was made in 1676 by Austrian Jakob Steiner. It may be as valuable as a Stradivarius. And it was left behind by burglars in a run-down apartment raided by police. Police believe the violin was stolen from the home of a family that has owned it for five generations and values it at $800,000. Detective Tom Ryan said Tuesday he found the violin as he searched an apartment in neighboring Daytona Beach for jewelry, guns and other items taken in a string of house burglaries in the last two weeks here and in adjoining Ormond Beach. Two men arrested last week tipped off police to the apartment, which they said also had been used by two other men as a stash house for stolen property. Ryan said he suspects the other men took the violin in an Oct. 20 burglary. Violins made by Steiner, who died in 1683, may be even rarer than those of the Italian Antonio Stradivari because Steiner made fewer of them, according to some collectors. According to library records, Stradivari made about 650 violins. The series of about 18 burglaries netted the crooks between $35,000 and $50,000 in jewelry and guns, police said. The two arrested, Jason Lee Signore, 18, and Edward Revas, 20, were picked up in an unrelated burglary, detectives said.", " A man stabbed his 8-year-old daughter to death and critically injured his three other children Saturday in a predawn rampage through the family home, police said. Michael Wayne Nida, 31, also cut his wife and then slashed his own wrists and stomach, and was arrested for investigation of homicide, police said. He was listed in serious condition at Sutter General Hospital. His wife, Diana Nida, received a superficial wound in the hand during the attack and was treated and released from University Medical Center. Neighbors said they watched horrified as the man fatally stabbed the girl with a 10-inch knife in the driveway, then apologized to her. When police arrived, they found four stabbed children lying in the living room. Officers were attacked by a pit bull dog, which they shot. Eight-year-old Laura Nida died at the medical center a short time later, police said. April, 4, and John and Erick, 7-year-old twins, were listed in critical condition Saturday night following surgery for multiple stab wounds. Police said neighbors had indicated that Nida might have been under the influence of drugs, though they gave no details. The Sacramento Bee quoted neighbors as saying that Nida often used crack, amphetamines, marijuana and alcohol. Shortly after the attack began, Mrs. Nida ran out of the house, naked and bleeding, and screaming ``He stabbed my babies and he cut me!'', witnesses said. Neighbor Terry Lauer said Nida emerged through the front door and approached his wife, saying: ``It's OK, man, I just want to talk to her.'' Lauer said he told him to go back into the house, and Nida did. Moments later, however, he ran from the front door again, this time chasing the 8-year-old girt with what Lauer described as a bowie knife. ``He caught up with her and they both ended up on the ground,'' Lauer said. ``I saw him pick her up by the hair, then stab her twice with the knife. Her body went limp.'' Lauer said Nida then knelt over his daughter, cradling her body in his arms. ``I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you,'' Lauer recalled Nida saying. Nica then carried the lifeless girl back into the house.", " Gang members returning from a friend's funeral allegedly used two rented limousines in a drive-by shooting that wounded one man, police said. The unidentified man was treated for a gunshot wound to the foot at Brotman Medical Center in Culver City after the 2:30 p.m. Thursday shooting, Sgt. Bob James said. James said no arrests were made immediately, but the limousines were impounded and the drivers questioned and released. ``These drivers don't know what these people are doing,'' James said. ``These people are in the back partying. The drivers don't know what's going on.'' On Tuesday, gang members opened fire from a limousine and killed 19-year-old Robert Lewis Riley Jr., police said. Both shootings were under investigation.", " State Sen. Greg Tarver was shot and wounded Saturday night, but refused to press charges after identifying the attacker as his wife, police said. The shooting happened at Tarver's home less than an hour after he returned from a special session of the Legislature in Baton Rouge. Police learned of the shooting when Tarver's mother phoned to report it, said Police Chief Charles Gruber. Tarver, 41, a senator since 1984 and one of only a handful of blacks in the 39-member body, was taken to LSU Medical Center, Gruber said. Hospital spokeswoman Elaine King said he was in stable condition, and a doctor said he was taken into surgery. Gruber said Tarver was shot once in the upper chest with a small caliber weapon about 6:45 p.m. ``He has identified his assailant as his wife, Sabrina,'' said Gruber, who disclosed no motive at a hospital news conference. ``There are no charges being filed at this time,'' Gruber said. ``She is not in custody at this time. We are not looking for her at this time. ``Sen. Tarver requested that we not pursue anything at the moment,'' he said, adding that police would pursue an investigation in case Tarver changed his mind about pressing charges. Gruber would not say where Mrs. Tarver was, and there was no answer at the Tarver home. Dr. Darryl Williams, dean of the LSU Medical School, said Tarver was taken into surgery. And, though he wouldn't speculate on the risk, Williams added: ``Any injury in that area can be life-threatening.'' Several of Tarver's legislative colleagues and one of Gov. Buddy Roemer's aides went to the hospital soon after he was shot.", " A panic-stricken 8-year-old girl concocted a story about two intruders after she accidentally killed her sister while playing with a gun, police said. The girl initially told police two men broke into a mobile home the family used as storage and shot her 10-year-old sister when the sister tried to call police, authorities said. Police launched a search Thursday for the intruders. Four hours later, the 8-year-old confessed she had found the .22-caliber revolver, and was playing with it when it discharged, Police Chief Richard Ausenbaugh said Thursday. The girl made up the story in panic and hid the weapon in the mobile home, he said. ``It's just an unfortunate, very, very tragic thing,'' Ausenbaugh said. ``She's just going to have to live with it for the rest of her life.'' He said no charges would be filed.", " A gunman shot two people this morning and took one of his victims hostage in a church, police said. The man shot the people about 8:45 a.m., said Julie Wolinksi, a police spokeswoman in Melbourne Beach. He then barricaded himself inside the Episcopal church, Saint Sebastian-By-The-Sea. No one else was believed to be inside the church, she said. But reporters at the scene heard a man and a woman screaming, leading them to believe two people were being held hostage. The gunman's identity was not immediately known, officials said. The other shooting victim was taken to the Holmes Regional Medical Center, Ms. Wolinski said. The victim, Diane Conarroe, was in surgery with two gunshot wounds to the abdomen, said hospital spokeswoman Valerie Davis. The 43-year-old woman was expected to be in surgery for most of the afternoon, Davis said. Police surrounded the church as a hostage negotiator from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office tried to talk the gunman into releasing the hostage and surrendering, she said. Homes and schools were being evacuated in this town of 2,600 people, 25 miles south of Cape Canaveral, authorities said.", " A motorist who was stopped early today on suspicion of drunken driving grabbed an officer's gun, wounding the officer and a second policeman before shooting himself to death, authorities said. Pembina County Sheriff's Deputy Miles Nelson stopped the suspect on a possible charge of driving under the influence shortly after 1 a.m., according to Deputy Cal Cluchie. An ``altercation'' occurred in which the man took Nelson's service handgun and shot him, Cluchie said. Nelson managed to call for assistance as the man fled. Cavalier Police Chief James Johnson, responding to the call, was also wounded as he attempted to stop the man, Cluchie said. The suspect was later found nearby with a fatal gunshot wound, apparently self-inflicted, he said. Nelson was listed in critical condition at the United Hospital in Grand Forks, and Johnson is listed in stable condition at Pembina County Memorial Hospital. No other details were immediately available. Cavalier is located about 15 miles south of the Canadian border in northeastern North Dakota.", " A 9-year-old runaway driving a van on Interstate 95 fled police at speeds up to 100 mph before crashing into a guardrail while his teen-age companions slept in the back, state police said. The boy was in critical condition at Johns Hopkins Hospital today with head and chest injuries, while his 14-year-old brother and their 12-year-old friend were in satisfactory condition, police said. The boys' names were not released because of their ages, and investigators were to meet with the youngsters' parents this morning, Maryland State Police Sgt. James Black said today. The three boys, from suburban Trenton, N.J., apparently were en route to Florida on Thursday in the van owned by the 12-year-old's parents, police said. The older boys were asleep in the back of the van during the chase, Black said, and are not cooperating with investigators. State police said they were told that a van was being driven erratically on the Delaware Turnpike, just across the Maryland line. The chase began when a Maryland trooper signaled the van to stop and it accelerated to speeds of up to 100 mph. The driver lost control, and the van veered across the median strip, slamming into a guardrail and overturning on the northbound lanes about 10 miles north of downtown Baltimore, police said.", " Gang members thwarted in an attempt to attack rivals rampaged through the city, killing one person and wounding up to nine others, police said Monday. The victims apparently were chosen at random during a four-hour spree of shootings and robberies Sunday night throughout this central California city of 350,000 people, said Sgt. Mike Guthrie. ``There doesn't seem to be any identifiable pattern,'' Guthrie said. ``I think it was more driving until they saw an opportunity and taking it.'' Police arrested four boys, ages 14, 15, 16 and 17, and confiscated five guns early Monday. All of those arrested are from Fresno, Guthrie said. Each was charged with one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of armed robbery. Their names were withheld because of their ages. One suspect remained at large and additional charges were pending against the four held, police said. Besides the three shotguns, one rifle and a handgun, police seized crack cocaine from one of the youths, Guthrie said. The rampage began after uniformed officers patrolled a drug-infested west Fresno neighborhood called ``the U,'' said Guthrie. Five gang members intended to shoot rivals, but left the area because of the police, Guthrie said. After the fatal shooting downtown, one juvenile left the group, Guthrie said. The other four robbed and shot people along an eight-mile stretch north to near Fresno State University, then headed back downtown, he said. ``This entire scenario was an afterthought,'' Guthrie said. The shooting spree was ``unprecedented in our city,'' he said. ``I can recall nothing of this magnitude ... There very easily could have been half a dozen or more murder victims.'' Police blamed the juveniles for the killing of a 47-year-old man and shootings that left six other men wounded. Two remained hospitalized Monday in serious condition, said Sgt. Dwight Williamson. The others weren't seriously wounded, he said. The victims' names were withheld released. Three other people were injured in shootings Sunday night and investigators were trying to determine whether the same youths were to blame.", " Here is a list of convicted killers executed since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death penalty in 1976:", " A federal judge Friday sentenced a former state auditor general to six years in prison for racketeering and tax fraud related to ``a sickening pattern of soliciting, accepting and paying bribes.'' Al Benedict, a one-time gubernatorial hopeful, also was fined $20,000 by U.S. Middle District Senior Judge Malcolm Muir, who said the sentence was intended as a deterrent for other public officials. The judge ordered Benedict to surrender to U.S. marshals on March 14. Benedict, 58, pleaded guilty last month to charges of racketeering and tax fraud. The racketeering charge encompassed 10 state bribery-related charges, which the government said occurred between April 1976 and November 1984. Benedict acknowledged accepting bribes in return for hiring and promoting state workers and for awarding no-bid contracts. He also admitted making a $6,000 payoff to a lawmaker in return for a bigger state appropriation for his department. ``I could never express to you how I feel ... the pain, suffering, embarrassment, humiliation,'' Benedict said in court. ``All I can attempt to do is atone for my transgressions and sins.'' Benedict refused to answer reporters' questions as he left the courthouse. His lawyer, Arthur Goldberg, said Benedict was surprised but not angered by the sentence. He could have been sentenced to up to 23 years in prison and $125,000 in fines. Federal prosecutors asked for a light sentence, citing Benedict's cooperation in a continuing investigation of state-government corruption. The defense, in a memorandum filed by Goldberg, asked for a one-year sentence with early parole and a term of public service. The memorandum portrays Benedict, a former television commentator who became de facto head of the state Democratic Party during two terms as auditor general, as a broken, humiliated man. It also places the blame for Benedict's predicament on his former top aide, John Kerr, who was convicted of masterminding the job-selling scheme. Kerr was sentenced to two to five years in prison and remains free on bail. He led investigators to Benedict late in 1986. Among the spectators at the sentencing was Joanne Dwyer, widow of state Treasurer R. Budd Dwyer. Her husband killed himself during a news conference last year, one day before he was to be sentenced by Muir on bribery-conspiracy charges. She criticized the plea-bargaining system that allowed Benedict to shorten his prison term and said her husband never got a chance to bargain because he was innocent and had been framed.", " Former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin has been found guilty of using cocaine after being jailed for failing to appear at his trial. Detroit Recorder's Court Judge John O'Brien ruled Thursday there wasn't enough evidence to convict Ruffin of a cocaine possession charge, but did find him guilty of using the drug. Ruffin faces up to a year in jail at his sentencing, scheduled for May 31. The singer was being held in Wayne County Jail pending a hearing on his failure to appear earlier this week. He failed to appear for court dates Monday and Tuesday morning and was arrested on a bench warrant when he showed up in Recorder's Court late Tuesday. Ruffin, 47, originally was charged with possessing a trace of cocaine after a July 28, 1987, raid on a friend's home. A co-defendant testified that he and Ruffin were among seven people who pitched in to buy 42 grams of crack cocaine. Ruffin, who lives near Detroit in South Lyon, said he went to the house to find a friend, not to buy drugs. But he admitted Thursday that he had used cocaine recently after O'Brien threatened to force him to take a drug test. Ruffin, who turned down an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge, sang with the Temptations, a top Motown group, from 1963 to 1968. He has recently been performing with another former Temptation, Eddie Kendricks.", " Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is being attacked in opposite directions by the Iran-Contra defendants, with one claiming he improperly ignored congressional testimony and the other three saying he illegally used it. Attorneys representing former national security adviser John M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and arms dealer Albert Hakim moved Thursday to dismiss the indictment against them, claiming Walsh illegally relied on testimony the three gave last year to the Iran-Contra congressional committees after being granted limited immunity. Because of the immunity grants, Walsh was required to collect all of his evidence independently. North, Piondexter and Hakim claim that, given the massive publicity surrounding the hearings, Walsh's case was inevitably tainted by exposure to their immunized _ regardless of efforts to insulate investigators and grand jurors from that evidence. But lawyers for retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, the fourth defendant, claim that Walsh unfairly ignored the congressional testimony of North and Poindexter. They say that testimony would have led the grand jury to decline to name their client in the 23-count indictment. Secord, who brokered the arms sales with Hakim, was the lead witness at last year's televised hearings of the House and Senate Iran-Contra committees and testified without any immunity. All four defendants are accused of conspiring to divert profits illegally from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. The so-called ``use immunity'' grants conferred by Congress on North, Poindexter and Hakim prohibit Walsh from using evidence obtained directly or indirectly from their congressional testimony. Walsh imposed special precautions to prevent his staff and the grand jury from being exposed to the extensive publicity surrounding the hearings. Prosecutors and grand jurors alike were told to ignore news reports or conversations with friends about the hearings. Evidence was filed under seal in U.S. District Court to prove that it was obtained independently of the immunized testimony. But in pleadings filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, lawyers for North, Poindexter and Hakim said those precautions were not enough. ``Never in the history of this nation has the immunized testimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all major networks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' the defense said. ``Given the widespread dissemination of immunized testimony throughout our society, the broad use of immunized testimony has been inevitable, undeniable, and so pervasive that the indictment must be dismissed as a matter of law,'' the defense argued. As an alternative to dismissing the charges, the defense asked Gesell to conduct a hearing to determine if immunized congressional testimony influenced Walsh's investigation. The defense says it wants to question grand jurors to determine if they learned about the congressional hearings from friends, relatives or news broadcasts or from grand jury witnesses. Secord's lawyers are taking a different course. They contend that Walsh unfairly refused to consider the congressional testimony of North and Poindexter, which they contend would vindicate their client of any wrongdoing. The grand jury should have had an opportunity to consider this testimony before returning an indictment against Secord, his lawyers said. ``The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorial convenience above General Secord's Fifth Amendment right to a fair and informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him and requires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictment be dismissed,'' Secord's lawyers said. Gesell has scheduled a hearing next Tuesday to discuss the immunity issue, which could take months to resolve.", " A former high-ranking state senator was sentenced Monday to 12 years in federal prison for corruption uncovered in an FBI sting in which he sold influence for campaign contributions. Paul Carpenter stood silently when U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia sentenced him, declining an offer to speak. Carpenter, a silver-haired 62-year-old Democrat from suburban Los Angeles, was convicted in September of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. The charges followed an undercover operation at the state capital. In the sting, an FBI agent posing as a businessman paid Carpenter $20,000 in campaign contributions to get a bill through the Legislature. At Carpenter's trial, other instances were cited of his shaking down lobbyists for campaign money. Carpenter, who must surrender to authorities by Jan. 7, was also ordered to repay $20,000 he received from an FBI undercover agent in the sting operation. ``It's a case of proven acceptance of bribery money and extortion of money in the form of political contributions,'' said the judge, who called the evidence against Carpenter ``overwhelming.'' The judge also observed that the former lawmaker felt no remorse. He said Carpenter's punishment was intended to deter others. Carpenter will be eligible for parole in four years. Carpenter's attorney, Gerard Hinckley, said he would appeal the sentence. A former Senate Democratic Caucus chairman, Carpenter was for several years one of that body's top fundraisers. After 12 years in the Senate, he was elected in 1986 to the Board of Equalization. His sentencing removes Carpenter from the powerful state tax board. Carpenter was the second elected state official snagged in the five-year FBI probe. Joseph Montoya was still a state senator when he was convicted in February of racketeering, extortion and money laundering. He is serving a 6{-year prison sentence. The investigation is continuing. So far four other people have pleaded guilty to charges that flowed from it - two former legislative aides and two former county law enforcers. Another two former legislative aides are awaiting trial. Most of the charges against Carpenter related to his dealings with John Brennan, an FBI agent who posed as Alabama businessman Jack Gordon. The agent paid Carpenter $20,000 in campaign contributions as a payoff for Carpenter's help in getting a bill through the Senate to finance a fictitious shrimp business. Carpenter said he told an aide he wouldn't take the money unless he was assured that he wouldn't have to do anything in return. However, the next day, in a tape-recorded conversation with Brennan, Carpenter promised to serve as the bill's problem-solver and to ``stroke'' the state treasurer to remove opposition to the measure. The bill was approved by the Legislature but vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who was tipped off to the FBI investigation.", " Seven guards at a prison operated by the District of Columbia have been charged with distributing crack, powdered cocaine or marijuana to inmates. The officers were named in six indictments unsealed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va. Their arrests were the result of a six-month undercover FBI investigation in which an inmate was an informant, officials said. Federal prosecutors said Friday that the probe revealed how guards at the Lorton Correctional Complex in Fairfax County, Va., enlisted inmates to make drug sales and arranged payments from outside the facility. They also alleged that the guards took bribes. U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson added, however, that the officers were not believed to be involved in a coordinated drug trafficking effort. ``What we have here are a number of isolated instances, all occurring at about the same time,'' he said during a Friday news conference. The investigation uncovered no widespread drug abuse by Lorton officers, said Walter B. Ridley, director of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections. His department runs the complex. The FBI launched the investigation because Lorton inmates appeared to have continual access to illegal drugs, said Thomas E. Duhadway, director of the FBI field office in Washington. Officials said charges against the officers ranged from possession with intent to distribute to introduction of narcotics into a prison. Each faces at least three counts. A civilian also was charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine. All those charged were released on personal recognizance bonds and ordered to appear for arraignments Monday in the Alexandria court.", " A former postman who pleaded guilty to stealing $2.50 from an envelope should be ordered to clean up his neighborhood with a ``broom, dustbin and plastic sack,'' a federal judge recommended. U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Higgins on Thursday also ordered Leon Watson, 33, to repay $315 that a January indictment charged he removed from envelopes carried on his route. Watson pleaded guilty to one count in a plea bargain calling for a maximum prison sentence of three years. That count charged him with stealing $2.50 from an envelope planted in a mailbox by U.S. Postal Service officials, who became suspicious of Watson after residents complained that they had received envelopes that were supposed to contain money but did not. ``I want Mr. Watson to become a custodian,'' Higgins said. ``He should be given a broom, dustbin and plastic sack and be made to keep good and clean'' parks and other public property near his home as community service work, the judge said. Higgins also ordered Watson to perform 300 hours of community service work and gave him a three-year suspended sentence.", " A man who pleaded guilty in connection with an elaborate scheme to sell stolen computer plans to the Soviet Union has been sentenced to six years in federal prison. Kevin Anderson, 30, pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to violate export laws and wire fraud in a plea bargain that apparently required his testimony against his alleged co-conspirator, Charles McVey. He had faced a maximum of 15 years. McVey is awaiting extradition from Canada for his role in the failed caper involving $4 million worth of technology manuals and programs from the Saxpy Corp. of Sunnyvale. Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 12 years for Anderson, citing the case's ``extraordinary seriousness.'' But U.S. District Judge William Ingram said at Friday's sentencing he was mainly concerned about the theft of materials from Saxpy and less about the purported danger to national security posed by the 1987 scheme, which was never completed. Because of the Saxpy computer's capabilities in antisubmarine warfare, the case threatened national security, prosecutors contended. ``The American computer technology involved in this case is among the most sophisticated and highly sought after by the Soviet bloc,'' the U.S. Department of Commerce said in a statement issued Friday. ``The documents and programs stolen from Saxpy would have allowed the Soviets to use this technology in anti-submarine warfare applicatons. ... If the shipments were successful, it would have been a major blow to our national security.'' Defense attorneys charged that federal officials had ``hyped'' charges in the case, saying they claimed Anderson had stolen ``the crown jewels of technology ... when it was really rhinestones at best.'' David Ellison, one of Anderson's attorneys, said that with credit for time served, Anderson could be free in 18 months.", " Two Americans and an Israeli have been charged in a federal indictment with conspiring to arrange the sale to Iran of three Israeli-owned U.S.-made military cargo planes. The indictment filed Thursday in U.S. District Court stemmed from an undercover investigation by the U.S. Customs Service. The sale, in which Iran was to buy the aircraft for $12 million each, never went through. The men, allegedly middlemen in the deal, were charged with conspiring to cover up the true destination of the C-130E transports by submitting to the State Department false papers that said a Brazilian company would buy them. Prosecutors said the proposed sale violated the Arms Export Control Act in which the State Department must approve all transfers abroad of American-made military goods. It prohibits the sale of such goods to countries such as Iran that have supported acts of international terrorism. Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss said he could not say whether Israel knew the planes were to be sold to Iran. The Brazilian company, which was not identified, allegedly was to receive $500,000 for providing the false information to the State Department, the indictment said. The defendants named in the indictment were Joseph O'Toole, 58, of Claremont, Calif.; Richard St. Francis, 40, of Fairfield, Conn.; and Ari Ben Menashe, an Israeli. All three were first arrested in April when the terms of the deal were finalized with an undercover Customs agent. The case was then presented to a grand jury, which returned the indictment, charging each with one count of conspiracy. Menashe has been jailed without bail since his arrest. The others are free on bond. Weiss said he could not give more information about the defendants. St. Francis, however, was identified in court papers as a vice president of the Connecticut office of Vienna, Va.-based TransCapital Corp. If convicted of conspiracy, the men face up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.", " A jury was selected Thursday for Raymond Buckey's second trial in the McMartin Pre-School child molestation case, the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. history. The seating of 12 regular jurors and six alternates came less than a month after attorneys began their inquiry to find panelists unbiased by publicity surrounding the first Buckey trial. Opening statements were set for Monday. Buckey, 31, who has been a defendant for nearly seven years, was acquitted of 40 molestation charges Jan. 18, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges. But prosecutors decided to retry Buckey on eight counts on which the jury deadlocked. A total of 13 charges were unresolved by that jury, but the prosecution dropped five of those counts. The first trial lasted nearly three years and cost $13 million. The eight remaining charges being tried involve three children who attended the now defunct McMartin preschool in Manhattan Beach _ a dramatically diminished group compared to the hundreds once described as alleged victims. Buckey and his lawyers, who had hoped for dismissal of all remaining charges, have accused District Attorney Ira Reiner of playing politics with the case. They say he decided to retry Buckey to further his own ambitions to become California attorney general. Reiner has denied any ulterior motives. Parents of McMartin school children campaigned loudly to have Buckey retried in the week after his acquittal on most charges. They conducted a letter-writing campaign, went on national TV talk shows and held press conferences to espouse their views. Deputy District Attorneys Joe Martinez and Pam Ferrero have said they hope the new trial can be concluded in six months. But Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg warned prospective jurors at the outset that the trial could continue into 1991.", " E.L. Doctorow's ``Billy Bathgate'' won the fiction category in the 1989 National Book Critics Circle awards announced Monday.

Lasky, who began his journalism career as a copy boy at The New York Journal American, covered World War II in Europe for Stars & Stripes, the soldiers' newspaper. After the war, he joined The New York World-Telegram and helped write a Pulitzer-Prize-winning series on Communist infiltration of American institutions.

In House races, Indiana Democrats managed to protect their 6-4 advantage over Republicans as all incumbents won.", " Conservative Republicans said Thursday that George Bush is headed for defeat in November if he chooses a running mate from the GOP's ``establishment blue-bloods.'' Bush, the certain Republican presidential nominee, is weighing a number of choices for the ticket's No. 2 spot and has indicated he will wait until the GOP convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18 to announce his decision. Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., chairman of the Coalition for a Winning Ticket, declined to single out the group's ideal vice presidential candidate. But he did say conservatives were disappointed by the selection of Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey as the convention's keynote speaker. Kean, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush running mate, is from the party's moderate wing and, like Bush, has an Ivy League background. ``The problem of the Bush campaign is that it is attracted to establishment blue-bloods. What the Bush ticket needs is a transfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of our party,'' Humphrey said at a news conference. Humphrey said a number of other possible Bush running mates from the party's moderate wing also were not acceptable to conservatives, including Richard Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania governor who has been chosen to succeed Attorney General Edwin Meese III; Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois; former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, and former Tennessee Sen. and White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. ``If George Bush selects an establishment Republican as his running mate, we believe we are headed for a disaster in November,'' Humphrey said. He described Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire as acceptable to conservatives. He was equivocal on other possible candidates, including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, Dole's wife Elizabeth Hanford Dole, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming. He said, however, that conservatives would probably not be enthusiastic about them.", " Sen. Paul Simon's home-state support appears to be slipping as the Illinois primary nears and he finds himself locked in a tight race with Jesse Jackson, according to the results of a newspaper poll to be published Monday. A Chicago Tribune poll of 500 Democrats likely to vote in Tuesday's primary shows Jackson with 32 percent of the support and Simon with 29 percent. But the poll, by Peter D. Hart and Associates has an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points, making the race a statistical dead heat. The latest poll, taken Friday and Saturday, updates one done earlier last week and published in Sunday's Tribune. That poll, with a similar sample and error margin, showed Simon holding 35 percent of the support to Jackson's 30 percent. ``I'm not saying every poll is inaccurate,'' Simon said while campaigning Sunday in Chicago's Chinatown. ``All I'm saying is if I get my message across to the people of Illinois, they're going to vote for me.'' Among other Democrats in the new poll, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was third with 20 percent, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri had 5 percent and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore had 4 percent. The Tribune said 9 percent of the voters were undecided and 1 percent preferred none of the candidates. The newspaper did not update its Sunday poll of GOP voters, which found Vice Presient George Bush the overwhelming favorite among Illinois Repbulicans over rivals Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and former TV evangelist Pat Robertson. The new Tribune poll found Jackson's support strongest in Chicago, which represents nearly half of the state's likely Democratic primary voters. Simon did best in counties closer to his Southern Illinois home of Makanda and in the rest of Cook County outside Chicago. Support for the two was split among racial and sexual lines. Jackson was strongest among blacks and men, while Simon's support was heaviest among whites and women, the poll results show. Among occupations, blue-collar workers supported Jackson far more than other job classifications, while Simon's support was nearly even among all occupations.", " The legislators who most closely oversee America's defense budget reaped $2 million in campaign contributions last year from political action committees affiliated with the defense industry. The biggest chunks went to committee leaders and other legislators who are particularly influential on military matters, according to an Associated Press analysis of campaign receipts by members of four key congressional panels. The committees will play a major role in determining how the pro-democracy movement in Eastern Europe and improved relations with the Soviet Union are translated into Pentagon budget cuts that could have a big impact on defense contractors. Ninety-two of the 104 legislators who serve on the four panels got money from defense PACs, with the largest share going to Sen. J. Bennett Johnson, a Louisiana Democrat who sits on the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee. Johnston received $128,000 from defense PACs whose sponsors read like a who's who of military contractors. The AP analysis covered PAC contributions to members of the defense subcommittees of the House and Senate appropriations committees, and to members of each chamber's Armed Services panel. In good times and bad, it is common practice for special interests to target their PAC contributions to legislators with influence in their fields. Banking-related PACs, for example, gave nearly $6 million in the 1987-88 election cycle to legislators on committees with jurisdiction over banking issues, according to the newsletter PACs & Lobbies. Congress for years has been debating campaign finance reforms that would limit the role of PACs in congressional races. Yet many lawmakers and PAC officials reject the contention of public interest groups that special-interest money unduly influences congressional votes. A spokesman for Johnston, Tony Garrett, said ``It makes sense that people in the defense industry would support those who favor a strong national defense and who are key players in defense policy. They also know the senator through his efforts to bring more defense industries to Louisiana.'' A prominent player in the campaign finance deliberations, Rep. Beryl Anthony, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said there is nothing wrong with accepting PAC money but that the soaring costs of campaigns have perhaps created the perception that lawmakers are too reliant on special interest money. ``Taking a legal PAC contribution is not sleazy,'' Anthony said in an interview Friday. ``The culprit is in how much money it takes to run an election.'' The 1989 PAC contributions, detailed in year-end campaign finance reports to the Federal Election Commission, cover the first half of the 1989-90 election cycle. Fund-raising generally escalates during election years, and past donors are among the first targets to be tapped. On top of PAC contributions, additional money from defense contractors is channeled to lawmakers as honoraria for speeches and other appearances. In 1987, for example, members of the four defense-related committees received $521,000 in honoraria from the top 50 defense contractors, according to the Common Cause advocacy group. Legislators also receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from labor union PACs whose members work at defense plants and from PACs for lobbying firms whose clients include major defense contractors. The $2 million figure, however, covers only donations from PACs affiliated with defense contractors. PACs affiliated with companies that would be most affected by major reductions in defense spending were among the biggest financial backers of members of the four congressional panels. General Motors Corp.'s PACs, for example, distributed nearly $140,000 last year among 75 members of the four defense-related committees, according to the AP analysis. GM's donations included those from its corporate PAC and from the PACs of its Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Aircraft subsidiaries. Not far behind was McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose two PACs gave $132,000 to 73 members of the congressional panels. Next were Textron Inc. and Lockheed Corp., whose PACs each made $103,000 in 1989 contributions to members of the four committees. Coming in just short of $100,000 in total donations to the committee members were the PACs associated with Grumman Corp., Northrop Corp. and Raytheon Co. Raytheon's totals include donations by the PAC of its Beech Aircraft subsidiary. PACs for Martin Marietta Corp., Rockwell International Corp., United Technologies Corp., Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., LTV Corp. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. contributed between $50,000 and $90,000 each to members of the defense-related congressional panels. While the chairmen and ranking Republicans of the congressional committees generally were among the biggest recipients of defense-industry PAC money, there was one major exception last year. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate defense appropriations panel, received just $1,000 in defense-industry PAC money; $2,150 in total PAC donations. Inouye, who is not up for re-election until 1992, received $52,000 in defense PAC money during the 1985-86 election cycle. The ranking Republican on that same panel, Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, reported defense-industry PAC contributions of $112,500 in 1989 and total PAC contributions of $497,000. He is heavily favored for re-election this year. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, received more than $489,000 from PACs in 1989, of which $88,000 came from the defense industry. The panel's ranking Republican, John Warner of Virginia, received $395,000 from PACs, $86,000 of it from the defense industry. Other big recipients of defense PAC money included: _Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee. He received $150,000 from PACs last year, $55,500 of it from the defense industry. _Rep. Joseph M. McDade of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the same panel. He raised $79,000 from PACs, $36,000 of it from the defense industry. McDade, who is under FBI investigation for his relationship with a now-defunct defense contractor, used all of his 1989 campaign contributions to pay legal fees. _Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Aspin received $135,000 from PACs last year, of which $41,000 came from the defense industry. _Rep. William L. Dickinson of Alabama, senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee. Dickinson received $52,000 last year from defense-industry PACs, representing 71 percent of his $72,000 in total PAC receipts.", " President Bush's 1991 defense budget could be cut nearly $6 billion through reductions including Star Wars spending and delaying a plan to put MX nuclear missiles on rail cars, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said Friday. Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., called for a military budget of $297 billion to $298 billion for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Bush wants a $303 billion budget, including an additional $1 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars. ``Assuming SDI is redirected into a coherent and rational research program, I believe it should be funded at roughly the current appropriated level,'' Nunn said in a speech on the Senate floor. Congress approved about $3.8 billion for the anti-missile shield in 1990's $296 billion defense budget. The SDI total marked the first reduction in the program in six years. Nunn's overall budget proposal is about $1.5 billion more than the cut adopted Thursday by the House Budget Committee and some $6 billion higher than the figure suggested by Senate Budget Committee chairman Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``I think the fight will be to try to keep defense even at the levels I'm talking about,'' Nunn said. He projected defense savings of about $3 billion to $3.5 billion this year from the changes in the strategic programs and between $20 billion and $30 billion over the next five years. Nunn's comments on the budget were the first by the powerful chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He is the leading defense expert among conservative Democrats. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, White House budget director Richard Darman dismissed all Democratic defense proposals and argued that lawmakers' affection for pet defense project in their districts will prevail over the cuts. ``As it gets much more clear what it means for particular congressmen's districts, you'll see the political system, independent of defense strategy, start to put a bottom on that defense cut,'' Darman said. Nunn called his budget range a ``realistic and responsible target.'' He said there should be a delay in placing multiple-warhead MX missiles on railroad cars and criticized the purchase of trains while the Pentagan is still conducting tests. The Bush budget calls for $2.2 billion to put 50 MX missiles on rail cars. Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and James Jeffords, R-Vt., introduced legislation Friday that would cut $1.6 billion of the administration proposal for the MX. That total represents all the procurement and military construction funds in Bush's budget for MX. ``The MX rail-garrison funding plan is a classic example of the flawed `buy before you fly' policy that has cost the country so much money in recent years,'' Levin said in a speech on the Senate floor. Nunn reiterated his support for the single-warhead Midgetman missile, but suggested deployment in existing silos with mobile launchers a later option. He repeated his opposition to development of a new short-range nuclear missile in Europe and questioned buying a new Trident submarine each year and Trident D-5 missiles with nuclear warheads in short supply. Nunn reserved comment on the B-2 stealth bomber until after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney briefs members of Congress on the Pentagon's review of major aircraft programs. However, Nunn said the B-2 program of 132 planes at a cost of $72 billion ``must be made more affordable.'' Nunn called for slashing Bush's defense budget authority to $289 billion to $291 billion, about $18 billion less than the president has proposed for fiscal 1991. Because budget authority represents the amount that can be spent over several years _ such as in a long-term contract to purchase warships _ the cut would force reductions in future Pentagon spending plans.", " Budget negotiators should limit next year's deficit cuts to $50 billion to $60 billion, far less than the law requires, say top fiscal experts for Congress and the Bush administration. The advice, if followed, would make it easier _ and less politically painful _ for participants in the budget summit to reach a deficit-reduction deal for 1991. White House officials and congressional leaders met in the Capitol Thursday for their second round of talks on the $1.2 trillion budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. That spending plan will have to contain an enormous amount of taxes or spending cuts to meet the $64 billion deficit ceiling mandated by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. At Thursday's session, negotiators did not agree on what size of budget-cutting package they need. ``It's bouncing all over the ballpark, $60 billion, $45 billion, $50 billion,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. Their own analysts gave them wildly differing figures about the size of the looming shortfall. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said next year's budget gap looks like it will be $149 billion to $159 billion. That would mean savings _ either new taxes or spending slashes _ of $85 billion to $95 billion to shrink the shortfall to the Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion. The White House's Office of Management and Budget projected a shortfall of $123 billion to $138 billion. That would necessitate $59 billion to $74 billion in cuts to hit the Gramm-Rudman ceiling. Neither set of figures includes the cost of rescuing the country's savings and loan institutions, a bailout that could cost the government tens of billions of dollars next year. Yet according to participants, CBO Director Robert Reischauer and OMB Director Richard Darman agreed that savings should be limited to $50 billion to $60 billion. The two budget experts said deficit cuts exceeding that amount could slow an already weak economy. Many economists worry that taking more than that amount away from consumers and government contractors _ in the form of higher taxes or spending cuts _ could prompt a recession. Some negotiators have said that loosening the deficit targets in the Gramm-Rudman law could be one way of keeping automatic cuts from taking effect. Darman also presented negotiators with examples of the spending cuts the Gramm-Rudman law would impose next year if Congress and President Bush fail to enact a deficit-reduction plan. The law would trigger enough cuts to reduce the deficit to $64 billion. According to the budget chief, $30 billion in Gramm-Rudman cuts would mean a 10.4 percent cut in domestic programs and a 7.6 percent reduction in defense spending. A $60 billion cutback would pare domestic programs by 22.2 percent and defense by 15.2 percent. In January, Bush released a proposed budget asserting that only $37 billion in savings would be needed to reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target. The administration says that since that time, projected costs of aiding the savings and loan industry have grown, interest rates have jumped and tax collections have dropped. Democrats point out that CBO and many private economists have been expecting the higher deficit figures for months. The budget talks are expected to last weeks or months. Both sides are being cautious in suggesting how to cope with a problem that could mean unpopular tax increases or spending reductions in an election year.", " The speaker of the Arizona House stripped two committee chairmen of their posts and threatened to resign Tuesday as she struggled for control of her rebellious Republican caucus. Speaker Jane Hull stripped Reps. Don Aldridge and Jim Skelly of their chairmanships, of the Public Institutions and Rural Development and House Judiciary committees, respectively, for voting against her. Mrs. Hull has clashed with conservative Republicans over a proposal to freeze the state's property tax rate and to pass along an income tax windfall to taxpayers. The proposal was offered by fellow Republican Margaret Updike, who said she wanted to ensure the Legislature didn't use the $170 million windfall or a property tax hike to balance a deficit budget. Majority Whip Chris Herstam tried to kill the proposal on a procedural motion. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in voting against him. But after Mrs. Hull threatened to replace any chairman who voted against Herstam, all Republicans except Aldridge and Skelly fell into line, giving Herstam a 32-25 margin. Rep. Brenda Burns sent Mrs. Hull a note during the debate, saying the conservatives would back down if she promised to allow a vote on Ms. Updike's proposal later. But Mrs. Hull refused to promise and tore up the note on the floor. She challenged the conservatives to try to remove her as speaker, and said she might resign. Later, after a three-hour closed caucus, Mrs. Hull said she had come ``pretty darned close'' to resigning, but decided against it ``because we were able to sit and rationally discuss the budget.'' House and Senate leaders have been trying for two weeks to drum up votes for a bipartisan budget and tax package, but conservative Republicans and a few Democrats in each chamber have balked. There has been talk of passing the $3.5 billion budget, which includes a deficit of about $400 million, without a tax package to fund it. Without specific legislation to the contrary, the windfall _ which has been passed on to taxpayers in past years _ would revert to the state, and the property-tax rate would be increased from its current 47 cents-per-$100 assessed valuation to whatever level would cover the deficit. Skelly, a 20-year veteran of the Legislature, is not seeking re-election and said losing his committee chairmanship was not significant because the session is almost over and no more committee meetings were scheduled. Aldridge said he was unwilling to give in to save his chairmanship. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Mark Killian, a leader of the conservative faction, said the conservatives still opposed the budget but recognized they could not block its passage. ``Some of us went and talked to the speaker and kind of put up the white flag,'' he said. ``There's another day and another war. Maybe we can do better next year.''", " A wide range of bills newly introduced in Congress would cut Social Security taxes, free billions of dollars for the nation's highways and cash in on the thaw in East-West relations by cutting Pentagon programs. Many of the bills introduced as lawmakers returned to work Tuesday after their winter recess would address the massive federal budget deficit and the gimmicks used to disguise the government's red ink. Also introduced were bills that would raise the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet status and allow women to serve in combat. The largest political storm has already formed over Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes. Moynihan was derided by the White House earlier this month when he announced the plan, which he formally introduced Tuesday. He would roll back Social Security payroll tax rate from the 7.65 percent it reached Jan. 1 to the previous 7.51 percent. That would save workers $7 billion this year and $55 billion in fiscal 1991. ``We must end the shameful practice of using Social Security revenues to finance budget deficits,'' said Moynihan, D-N.Y. The surplus in Social Security reserves is counted in the budget, making the deficit appear smaller than it actually is. The surpluses are the result of efforts to build up reserves for the Baby Boom generation when it ages and will dwindle after the turn of the century. But the Bush administration calls the move part of a Democratic plot to raise other taxes. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., meanwhile, rolled various tax proposals _ including his perennial call for a national sales tax _ into a Tax Reform and Competiveness Act. The legislation embraces some of President Bush's proposal to lower the capital gains tax and includes Moynihan's Social Security proposal and a plan by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to restore the tax deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts. This is the fifth straight year Hollings has introduced legislation for a value added tax, as the sales tax is known. On another budget front, Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., introduced legislation he said would release more than $10.5 billion in highway money being held in the federal Highway Trust Fund. The money represents the accumulated difference between revenues _ larely from the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax _ and federal highway authorizations. Critics say the money is deliberately underspent to keep the deficit low and provide a cheap source for government borrowing. ``Over the last decade the federal government has used the money collected by the federal gas tax as a deficit-reduction gimmick,'' Bryan said. Legislation to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet level status was introduced in the House and Senate, with supporters saying they hoped a bill could clear Congress within several months. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee, said the EPA needs more clout and higher visibility because of the importance of environmental issues in the next decade. Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., moved to translate changes in the Soviet Bloc into less military spending, introducing legislation to cancel the B-1 stealth bomber program after the 15 bombers now in production are built. ``Recent events have made the argument against the B-2 even stronger,'' said Leahy. He said taxpayers would save $40 billion as a result. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., introduced a bill she has been touting since the U.S. invasion of Panama last month that would remove existing prohibitions on women serving in combat. Cranston, under investigation for his role in the scandal over the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan, introduced legislation that would allow the 23,000 holders of worthless junk bonds sold through Lincoln to sue federal regulators for approving the sale. Cranston is one of five senators under an ethics inquiry for receiving contributions from Lincoln owner Charles Keating Jr. and intervening with federal regulators on Keating's behalf. A bill introduced by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would bar senators from taking honoraria and limit outside earned income to 15 percent of salary. The measure would bring Senate rules in line with those approved by the House last year. Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit senators and members of the House to 12 years in office. Humphrey said the amendment would ``go a long way toward restoring a truly representative Congress.'' In other legislation Tuesday: _Reps. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., and Joseph Brennan, D-Maine, introduced separate bills to raise low-income energy assistance subsidies after a cold snap and low inventories sent heating oil costs skyrocketing 50 percent last month. _Banks and thrifts that launder drug money would lose their charters under a bill introduced by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill, chairman of the House Banking financial institutions subcommittee. _And Rep. James Trafficant, D-Ohio, introduced a bill to repeal the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, calling the law ``that turkey that should be shot down.''", " Late this week, budget talks between the Bush administration and Congress should evolve from preliminary, technical discussions into hard bargaining with election-year politics and billions of dollars at stake. But none of the participants pretends to know what will happen. ``I wouldn't hazard a guess,'' said one, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``These things can go on for so long, and then suddenly as if by magic you seem to reach a critical mass and then there's an agreement.'' After five weeks and eight private sessions, the Democratic and Republican sides agree that somewhere between $45 billion and $60 billion in new taxes and spending cuts are needed for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1. Unless some deal is worked out by that date, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will force tens of billions of dollars worth of spending cuts, an amount both parties say is intolerable. Yet neither side is eager to be the first to lay a plan on the bargaining table at sessions continuing this week, and risk being accused of championing something that the voters might find dreadful. Among the battlegrounds: will Democrats have to swallow cuts in some of their favorite social programs? And will President Bush's campaign mantra of ``No new taxes'' become obsolete? Democrats say the bargaining can only begin with a concrete offer from Bush, who called for the talks early last month. ``I thought implicitly at the beginning that the administration would present a proposal here,'' Sasser said last week. But Republicans say there is no need for the White House to lay down a proposal, and it has no plans to do so. If Democrats continue to insist that Bush present a budget proposal, ``It would be clear at that point that the Democrats don't intend to work out an agreement,'' said a GOP bargainer, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, a Republican negotiator who will retire from Congress this winter, said he might be willing to push a plan forward if no one else will. ``If they need a fall guy, and it's said that lame ducks are good at that kind of stuff, I wouldn't mind being put in that position,'' he said. But that's not likely to satisfy Democrats. ``We're not interested in hearing from Republican legislative members,'' said Sasser. ``That's not what it's all about. This is a negotiation between the executive and legislative branches.'' Contributing to the unpredictability of the talks is the schizophrenic outlooks of the Democratic and Republican teams. Each side has pragmatists like White House budget director Richard Darman and House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. They seem above all to want a deal that once and for all takes a bite out of the federal deficit, which some project could exceed $200 billion next year. But the two teams also have highly partisan members, such as Sasser and White House chief of staff John Sununu, who seem leery of agreeing to anything that might provide a campaign advantage to the other party. Bargainers say the litmus test for the talks will be whether they have accomplished anything by the start of Congress' July 4 recess. They argue that agreement is needed by around then for lawmakers to have time this year to enact a deficit-reduction package. ``Everyone feels that if we work day to day until then, we ought to be either well on our way to putting an agreement together or be pretty much facing a task that's harder than everybody thought,'' said Panetta.", " In an election-year bow to an agency that serves one-third of all Americans, the Senate voted Tuesday to give the Veterans Administration a seat in the president's Cabinet. The bill was passed by an 84-11 vote. The House approved similar legislation last November, a week after the idea was advanced by President Reagan. Negotiators from the the Senate and House will work out minor differences between the two bills. The Department of Veterans' Affairs would become the 14th in the Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 1989. Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the bill another example of congressional pandering to special interests. ``In recent years the VA has frequently been relegated to a relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the administrator having little or no access to the president or other top officials in the White House,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who has been promoting a veterans' department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting more money for veterans. ``Given the nature and scope of the VA, it is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... (to) ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively administered.'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., a former Veterans Committee chairman, opposed creation of the Cabinet seat. He bitterly criticized some veterans' service organizations for supporting the bill while they fought another measure, passed Monday by the Senate, that would allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans' benefits. ``If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I've missed something in the nine years I've been year,'' Simpson said. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., called the bill ``absurd... silly... goofy... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish. This is unprincipled (prostitution) after special-interest groups.'' According to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $30 billion, making it the largest independent federal agency. It will dispense $14 billion in income maintenance and $626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that converting the VA into a Cabinet department would cost $33 million over five years. The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA buildings. The bill would reorganize VA operations and allow the secretary of veterans' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 15 deputy assistants. The legislation requires that the top operating officers _ the chief medical director and chief benefits director _ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard to politics. Voting against elevating VA to the Cabinet were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Humphrey; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; James McClure, R-Idaho; William Proxmire, D-Wis.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Simpson, and Steven Symms, R-Idaho. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Paul Trible, R-Va., and John Warner, R-Va.", " The House on Thursday rejected a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from desecration, heeding opponents who said it would risk damage to the Bill of Rights. The 254-177 tally left the amendment, which was supported by President Bush, 34 votes short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Republicans voted 159-17 for it, Democrats 160-95 against. The vote followed a sometimes impassioned day of debate featuring more than 100 speeches, including a rare address by the speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``We should not amend the Constitution of the United States to reach the sparse and scattered and despicable conduct of a few who would dishonor the flag and defile it,'' said Foley, who also cast a rare speaker's vote to register his opposition to the amendment. By tradition, the speaker does not normally engage in debate or vote. Countered Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.: ``Let us take the flag out of the gutter where the counterculture has dragged it and is smearing it. We have 10 amendments that guarantee us all sorts of rights. How about one amendment that gives us a duty?'' Foley told reporters that Thursday's vote would be the last one on the amendment this year in the House, but Republicans promised to keep the issue alive. ``I am confident this debate is going to go on for a long time,'' Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told the chamber. Asked about the Bush's efforts on behalf of the amendment, Gingrich said ``it was very hard for the president in two days to override the speaker.'' Supporters of the amendment, backed by veterans' groups seeking more time to lobby, had tried to delay Thursday's vote until next week but were defeated 231-192. Rep. Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., the chairman of the House Veterans Committee and the amendment's prime Democratic sponsor, said of the proposal, ``I think we owe it to the brave Americans who have died for this country.'' But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., decried the attempt to modify the First Amendment. ``When I look around the politicians today, I see more people who remind me of Daffy Duck than Thomas Jefferson,'' he said. The strength of the opposition was larger than expected and was aided by the unexpected support of some conservatives. ``Up until 24 hours ago, I was a sponsor of this amendment,'' said Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C. ``But over the rhetoric of the past few days, I finally heard the voice of my own conscience.'' The amendment read, ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United States.'' It was first proposed in 1989 after the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning was a form of protected free speech. The issue was revived last week when the court rejected last year's attempt to pass an anti-flag-burning law that the court could accept. After the vote on the amendment, the House also rejected a new statute _ not a constitutional amendment _ to ban flag burning. The bill, narrowly drawn in hopes of avoiding court rejection, would impose fines and jail terms for people who burn flags to promote violence or who burn flags on federal property or belonging to the federal government. Republicans voted overwhelmingly against it after their leadership called it a ``fig leaf'' to protect Democrats who opposed the constitutional amendment, and it lost 236-179. The Senate is expected to vote next week on the amendment, which would require a two-thirds vote in both chambers, and approval by 38 of the 50 states, for ratification. Foley said the House would not vote again this year. Regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill, Republicans promise to raise the issue in this fall's campaign. The House majority leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., acknowledged the political tightrope members were walking. Several members decorated their speeches with flags and other props. Rep. Gary Ackerman, trying to highlight the difficulty of enforcing legislation to protect the flag, held aloft a wide variety of household items and gags decorated with the stars and stripes. ``How about American flag napkins,'' he said, holding one. ``What if you blow your nose in one. Have you broken the law?'' Although Ackerman said he was not trying to trivialize the debate, Rep. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said he was offended. Most Republican speakers supported the amendment; the bulk of opposition came from Democrats. There also was a noticeable generational tilt in the debate. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., a decorated World War II veteran, co-sponsored the amendment and called it ``a measured, prudent, limited thoughtful approach to the problem.'' ``Surely this is something different from the `assault on the Bill of Rights' some critics say it is,'' he said. Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., another World War II vet, used photographs of the famed Iwo Jima flag raising and of a flag-burning protest in New York's Central Park to dramatize his support for the amendment. But Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a Vietnam veteran who said he would ``never forget the sacrifices that have been made so that our flag can fly proudly and freely,'' was a leader of the opposition. ``In 200 years of our history, these basic freedoms have never been amended, never. And if we start now, who knows what freedoms will be next? ... Where will it end?'' he asked.", " President-elect George Bush has been given the glum news that the budget deficit in the next fiscal year will be $21 billion higher than the Reagan administration had previously estimated. That information means that Bush will be facing an even bigger budget headache when he takes office on Jan. 20. The new deficit estimate was presented to Bush and President Reagan during a Cabinet briefing Thursday on the administration's final budget submission to Congress. Joseph Wright Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the OMB now estimates that the deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, will be $132 billion, substantially higher than the $111 billion deficit estimate OMB made just three months ago. Officials said the main factors boosting the deficit estimate were the drought, which slowed economic growth this year, and higher-than-expected interest rates, which raised the cost of financing the $2.6 trillion national debt. The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's deficit target for 1990 is $100 billion, which means that $32 billion in budget cuts will be needed to close the gap between revenues and spending. Achieving such sizable cuts in the face of congressional opposition to further reductions in domestic programs will present Bush with major political problems. During the campaign, Bush sidestepped specifics on how he would deal with the budget deficit by touting a plan for a ``flexible freeze.'' Bush said he would allow government spending to grow only enough to match inflation. Within the overall freeze, selected programs could grow while others would be cut. However, Bush avoided providing details on what programs he would cut in order to free funds for increases that he promised to make in education, child care and health care for the poor. The budget document Reagan sends to Congress on Jan. 9 will reflect his decisions, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. However, officials said it was likely that Bush would rewrite at least part of the document once he takes office, just as Reagan did in 1981 when he submitted his own budget to Congress in place of the budget left behind by President Carter. Officials refused to comment on reports that the final Reagan budget will call for substantial increases in defense spending and steep cuts in domestic programs as a way of providing Bush with the opportunity to present a ``kinder, gentler'' budget blueprint once he takes office. OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay said that Reagan's final budget would not include any tax increases, something the president has consistently opposed, or seek to trim Social Security benefits as a way of meeting the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman deficit target. ``We have some difficult choices ahead'' on where to cut spending, she said. With estimates on future deficits rising, many private economists are convinced that Bush will be forced to accept some type of tax increase despite his oft-repeated opposition to new taxes during the campaign. As examples of pressure for increased spending, they point to public demands that the government do more in the fight against drugs, and to estimates topping $50 billion for the cost of bailing out hundreds of insolvent savings and loan institutions. House Speaker Jim Wright on Thursday said that the first signal on whether Bush is serious about reducing the budget deficit is likely to come from his appointment of two members to the National Economic Commission, a bipartisan advisory group created to come up with a blueprint for eliminating the budget deficit. Bush criticized the commission during the campaign as a device for raising taxes, but Wright said if Bush is serious about dealing with the deficit, he will weigh carefully his appointments, which are expected to be made soon. ``Will they be pragmatic people, will they be realistic people, will they be people dedicated to finding a true solution to this enormous budget crisis?'' Wright, D-Texas, asked. ``I think that may be his first signal.'' Also providing hope to some that a resolution can be reached in the seven-year budget deadlock is the widespread expectation that Bush will name Richard Darman as the new budget director. Darman, a longtime aide to former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, is considered a pragmatist who would seek to work with Congress in crafting deficit-cutting solutions. Wright repeatedly refused to offer his own view on how to make the needed budget savings although he said he had many questions about how Bush's flexible freeze would work. ``I have an open mind and I'm willing to listen to the president's refinement of exactly how he interprets the meaning of that phrase,'' Wright said.", " The Senate today voted down an effort to ban most U.S. underground nuclear testing, rejecting claims by supporters of the ban that it would help stem the atomic arms race. The chamber voted 57-39 to kill the proposed ban as it worked through a Pentagon budget bill. ``We must maintain unquestionable confidence in our nuclear deterrent and our experts tell us that this requires continued testing,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-N.C., a chief opponent. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., the sponsor of the ban, said, ``no other issue addresses so clearly the runaway technology which is the lifeblood of the arms race.'' The House has approved an underground test ban in its version of the defense bill, meaning the issue will have to be resolved by a House-Senate conference committee that will resolve differences between the two measures. The House passed its defense bill Wednesday and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said the U.S. military is ``stronger and more capable'' now than when President Reagan took office, despite Reagan's recurring complaints about not getting enough money for the Pentagon. ``By almost any measure, our armed services are better than they were in 1981,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis. ``The most dramatic increase is the quality of people, which is much, much better.'' Aspin commented shortly after the House voted 252-172 for a Pentagon budget, which will be the last defense budget of Reagan's eight-year presidency. House approval split along party lines, with majority Democrats supporting the bill and Republicans opposing it. Reagan didn't like it either, joining complaints by House Republicans that the bill unfairly restricts his arms control policies and Star Wars program. The House measure bans Star Wars tests that violate the so-called ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and bars the purchase of any nuclear weapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT II nuclear arms treaty. The Senate, by a 51-45 margin, rejected an attempt Wednesday to add the SALT II restriction to its defense bill. Reagan opposes both restrictions and is also unhappy with the $3.5 billion approved by the House for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The Senate voted Wednesday for $4.6 billion. Reagan wanted $4.8 billion for Star Wars next year, compared with the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion. Aspin said he couldn't understand the presidential complaints. ``I don't believe the president has any reason to be upset. I think it's a good bill. We gave the president a lot of what he wanted.'' Both the House and Senate bills authorize $299.5 billion worth of defense spending in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a slight reduction from the current $300 billion Pentagon budget. The measures would essentially freeze defense spending for a fourth straight year, following four large annual increases in Reagan's first term. No increases are likely in the future, Aspin predicted. ``I would guess that you're looking at perhaps a freeze, or maybe a decline of 1 or 2 percent, for the foreseeable future, which is the next three or four years, no matter who is elected president.'' Several factors will contribute to the reluctance to increase defense budgets, said Aspin. ``First, there are the worries about the federal budget deficit. Then second, you have the fact that the Soviets appear to the American public to be less threatening under Mikhail Gorbachev, so there's less a push because of fear. ``You also have the fact that there are other fears, like drugs,'' he said, noting that the House bill orders Reagan to use the U.S. military in the fight against illegal drug smuggling. ``In addition, there is a growing perception that national security depends on other things than simply military might, that it needs to include economic strength,'' he said. While the House measure restricts Reagan's arms control policies and Star Wars, it granted his proposals for a vast variety of weapons. That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets, 42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new Navy destroyers, two more attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the first of the new ``Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks. The Senate decision on Star Wars came as the chamber voted 50-48 against a deep reduction in the 5-year-old program. That vote defeated a proposal by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., to reduce the SDI budget to about $3.8 billion and devote the extra $750 million to the space shuttle and a space station.", " Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms swept through Alabama and northern Florida today after large chunks of hail pelted portions of Louisiana and high winds ripped down power lines in Arkansas.

Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy of Coast Guard Air Station-Ellington said the helicopter was dispatched to the 70-foot commercial shrimper, Master Warren, shortly after 3 a.m. when the three notified authorities that the vessel was ablaze some 13 miles southwest of Galveston. The boat was about five miles from shore, he said. ``They found the vessel fully engulfed in flames and the three people standing as far back as possible,'' Kennedy said. ``They seemed to be suffering from smoke inhalation, so after they were hoisted off the vessel they were taken to John Sealy Hospital in Galveston.'' Doctors there found the men in good condition and they were not admitted, Kennedy said. The owner and operator of the Master Warren, which is based in Port Arthur, was identified as Banh Prinh, and the two crew members were identified as Bob and Pan Nguyen, Kennedy said. Coast Guard crews continued to battle the fire aboard the shrimper this morning. ``Just about the time that the helicopter crew was hoisting the people, a patrol boat from the Coast Guard base in Galveston arrived at the scene and began fighting the fire,'' Kennedy said, adding that another boat was expected to arrive later and tow the shrimper to shore.", " A Finnish military training plane failed to come out of a spin during an air show stunt and crashed, killing the pilot hours after an air show disaster claimed more than 40 lives in West Germany. The crash Sunday at Kleine Brogel Air Base, 68 miles northeast of Brussels, was the second such air accident this month in Belgium. Witnesses said one of the two Redigo aircraft taking part in the show organized by the Belgian air force was unable to come out of a spin during stunt manuevers and plunged to the ground. Officials said the pilot, Ari Piippo, was flying too low to enable him to safely eject from the plane, which belonged to the state-owned Finnish aircraft maker Valmet. Valmet recently sold 10 Redigo airplanes to Finland's air force for training purposes. On Aug. 7, a Belgian pilot died when his Mirage-5 jetfighter crashed at an air show, also organized by the Belgian air force, at Leopoldsburg, seven miles west of Kleine Brogel Air Base.", " Two Navy jets collided over the Atlantic on Thursday, killing one pilot and injuring the other, authorities said. The planes were taking part in an exercise around noon when the accident occurred 70 miles southeast of Jacksonville, the Navy said. The pilot killed was flying a single-engine A-4F attack jet from Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia, said Bert Byers, a spokesman for Cecil Field Naval Air Station. The pilot's identity was not immediately released. The other pilot, Cmdr. David R. Miller, 39, of Orange Park, was rescued and was reported to be alert and talking at a hospital. Miller was flying a twin-engine, single-seat FA-18 Hornet, a strike fighter. The cause of the accident is under investigation.", " A military training plane crashed into a reservoir Tuesday during an exercise, and both the instructor and pilot were killed, the air force reported. The B-34 trainer crashed into the Tsengwen reservoir in Tainan, southern Taiwan, at about 11:30 a.m., the air force said in a brief statement. An air force official said an instructor and the pilot were the only people on board. Tainan is 185 miles south of Taipei. The cause of the accident was being investigated.", " A British soldier has died of injuries suffered at the Ramstein air show disaster on Aug. 28, bringing the death toll to 70, officials said Wednesday. The 40-year-old soldier, who was not identified, died over the weekend in a hospital in Hanover, said Juergen Dietzen, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry of Rhineland Palatinate state. Dietzen said 24 people remain hospitalized in 10 facilities, and four are in critical condition. The accident occurred when three Italian stunt planes collided at an annual air show at the Ramstein U.S. Air Force base. One of the planes plunged into the crowd. Authorities gave the following nationality breakdown for the dead: 60 West Germans, four Americans, one Dutch citizen, one French citizen, the British soldier and the three Italian pilots.", " A tanker carrying 375,000 gallons of fuel oil ran aground today in the Delaware River but was refloated a few hours later without any apparent leaks, authorities said. The Norwegian tanker Manhattan Princess, operated by Ahlers Shipping of Belgium, grounded on a muddy bottom on the New Jersey side of the river at 12:45 a.m. today, said Coast Guard Lt. Pete Hoffman. Coast Guard Lt. Pete Hoffman said two tugboats pulling on the tanker got it off the bottom with little trouble after high tide arrived about 9:15 a.m. Investigators found no leakage or ship damage, he said. The ship, drawing 37 feet of water, was en route to the Hess terminal in Pennsauken, N.J., when it wandered out of the 40-foot deep channel. An investigator went along with the tanker to look into the cause of the grounding, Hoffman said. The ease of refloating the tanker was an indication that the tanker wasn't very hard aground on the soft, muddy bottom, Hoffman said, and it also suggested that there wouldn't be any damage to the hull.", " A single-engine, banner-towing plane on its way to the beaches crashed and burned shortly after taking off Saturday, killing the pilot, officials said. Jack Beale took off around 11 a.m. from the landing strip at Sky Signs' banner-plane airfield near Conway, just northwest of this resort, when the plane's engine apparently stalled and the plane crashed, officials said. The 63-year-old Conway man had just picked up a new advertising banner, which he was going to tow over the beachfront. He had no passengers. The plane exploded on impact, and the flames had virtually burned out when firefighters arrived, said Charlie Brown of the Horry County Volunteer Fire Department. Beale had been flying for Sky Signs for about three months, said company co-owner Mike Marion. Federal Aviation Administration officials from Atlanta were on their way to the crash site to investigate the accident.", " The aircraft carrier used to train the Navy's sailors and pilots _ the USS Lexington _ will be decomissioned in mid-1991, the Navy announced Wednesday. The USS Forrestal, which is homeported in Mayport, Fla., has been named to replace the Lexington as the service's training carrier. The Lexington was the site of a major accident last fall, when a jet pilot making his first landing crashed into the deck, killing himself and four others. In a statement issued at the Pentagon, the Navy said it had opted to retire the 47-year-old carrier rather than perform an overhaul to extend its service life. Since 1962, the Lexington has been used to qualify thousands of naval aviators, and it has recorded more than 490,000 aircraft landings on its flight deck. The Lexington was launched in 1942. During World War II, its crew destroyed more than 1,000 enemy planes and sank 300,000 tons of shipping, earning it the nickname ``The Blue Ghost'' and the reputation that it couldn't be sunk.", " Using too much water to douse the fire aboard the Mega Borg could sink the oil supertanker, but firefighters using foam to smother the flames today faced another problem, salvage experts say. ``You have to get on that ship to extinguish it,'' said Les Williams, whose Port Arthur, Texas, salvage company has fought nearly two dozen offshore oil fires. ``If the fire's below deck, it's like trying to walk on a hot skillet. You can't do that.'' The fire burned since Saturday aboard the 853-foot Norwegian ship, crippled in the Gulf of Mexico 57 miles southeast of Galveston. It started with an explosion in the engine room on Saturday; five blasts Sunday sent blazing crude oil from the tanker's 38-million-gallon cargo into the sea. ``That's a very hard fire to fight, there in the engine room like that,'' Rudy Teichmann of T&T Marine Salvage Inc. in Galveston said. ``It's all closed up and you can't get to it. ``They can't flood that engine room with water. That could sink the ship. It's a lot different than fighting a forest fire,'' said Teichmann. The Mega Borg already was listing. Its stern dropped 58 feet since the first explosion, indicating either the cargo had shifted or the ship was taking on water, the Coast Guard said. The aft deck was reported just 5 feet above the water today. About 30,000 gallons of foam has been shipped to the scene, the Coast Guard said. But using it entails firefighting at close range. Wiliams said the usual procedure is for two or three firefighters, wearing fire-retardant jumpsuits that are light enough to swim in, to board the tanker. Carrying a 3-inch diameter hose leading to foam pumps aboard a nearby boat, they target the fire's point of origin, he said. The hose, or ``wand,'' can shoot 5,000 gallons of foam per minute. Attempting the job is Smit American Salvage Inc., the U.S. division of a Rotterdam company. Smit has helped fight more than 100 tanker and oil rig fires, including blazes in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war, company officials said. Steve Davis, captain of the 180-foot supply boat Tradewind, and his crew of four spent Sunday loading drums of chemical foam on board the boat to fight the Mega Borg fire. ``I would hate to see oil all over these beaches,'' Davis said as specialists from the Netherlands finished bolting high-powered pumps and nozzle connections to the ship's deck. Davis' boat is one of six from Pelican Island near Galveston that were hired to fight the fire. ``God willing and weather permitting _ that's the saying in salvage,'' said Rick Chianelli, salvage foreman for Smit American.", " Here is a brief economic rundown of the countries collectively referred to as Eastern Europe:", " The Soviet Union on Tuesday stopped jamming Radio Liberty broadcasts for the first time in 38 years, officials said today, as thousands of jamming transmitters blocking most Western broadcasts into the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were silenced. Jane Lester, spokeswoman for Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty, said the service monitored all of its broadcasts overnight and found no jamming except for Radio Free Europe transmissions to Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. ``This is really a momentous event,'' said Stanley Leinwoll, U.S. engineering director for the services in New York City. He said between 2,000 and 2,500 jamming devices were shut down in the Soviet Union, along with others run by Eastern European governments. The lifting affected most Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty and Radio Free Afghanistan services of the U.S. government along with most Israeli KOL transmissions and West German Deutsch Velle broadcasts beamed toward the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said Beth Knisley, a spokeswoman for the Voice of America. Radio Liberty, run by the U.S. government, broadcasts in native languages to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from Munich, West Germany. VOA also broadcasts to those areas but operates separately from Radio Liberty. Only the VOA and West German broadcasts into Afghanistan and U.S. broadcasts into Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria remained jammed last night, Ms. Knisley said. She said the Soviets have not said why the jamming was stopped but added, ``It saves them a lot of money, though.'' The Soviets stopped jamming nearly all broadcasts by VOA, which transmits in 43 languages throughout the world, in May 1986. Last Jan. 1, Polish jamming of VOA also stopped. The Soviets have been jamming Radio Liberty continuously for more than three decades. Ms. Knisley said one listener who talked to a VOA researcher said Tuesday he had picked up a broadcast for the first time since the 1950s. She said she did not know where the listener lived. VOA is part of the United States Information Agency, but Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty operates as a separate government radio service. ``The jamming stopped as of last night about 9 p.m. (4 p.m. EST),'' Radio Liberty spokesman Bob Redlich said in Munich. Radio Liberty transmits news, music and information programs to the Soviet Union in more than a dozen languages. Radio Free Europe transmits to the other Soviet Bloc countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria in their own languages. Radio Free Europe began operating in 1950; Radio Liberty started its tranmissions to the Soviet Union in 1951.", " Two monasteries have been returned to Armenian church officials by the government, the Tass news agency said. The official news agency said on Wednesday that Armenian authorities returned to the church the Tateva monastery, built in the 9th century, and the Makaravank monastery, built between the 11th and 13th centuries. The government in Armenia, a southern Soviet republic that borders Turkey, also returned three mosques to religious officials, Tass said. It quoted Patriarch-Catholicos Vazgen of the Armenian church as saying the return of the facilities was an example of improved church-state relations. Tass said the monasteries had been under state protection for many years, but provided no other details about them.", " The main opposition party urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl to dismantle some nuclear missiles before the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty is ratified, as the Kremlin has done. East Germany's state-run news agency ADN reported that Soviet SS-12 missiles in Waren, an East German site northwest of Berlin, were dismantled, put in crates and were ready for transport back to the Soviet Union. The SS-12s are part of the U.S.-Soviet agreement last December to eliminate medium-range and shorter-range missiles within three years. The treaty applies to nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to 3,000 miles. Hermann Scheer, disarmament expert for West Germany's opposition Social Democrats, told reporters that Kohl's government should respond to the Soviet move with the early scrapping of West Germany's 72 Pershing 1A missiles. ``Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust in disarmament which the leadership in East Berlin has been working toward with the Soviets,'' Scheer said, speaking on behalf of the party. East German newspapers praised Soviet plans for early removal of the SS-12 missiles from Waren. ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from the DDR (East Germany). Troops in Waren dismantle medium-range rockets earlier than expected,'' the Communist party's official newspaper, New Germany, said in banner headlines Wednesday. ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or when they would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Soviet soldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12 rockets.'' ``With this step we can make an important contribution toward disarmament even before the treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN said. The East Berlin-based newspaper Berliner Zeitung said Wednesday: ``Removal of missile troops from the DDR (East Germany) starts earlier than expected.'' President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the superpower treaty in Washington last December. Kohl had announced beforehand that West Germany would scrap its Pershing 1A missiles if a treaty was agreed upon. West Germany owns the Pershing 1A missiles, but the United States controls the nuclear warheads for the rockets. Three U.S. Senate committees are debating the treaty and ratification may come this summer. The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's parliament, is expected to approve the accord. East German leader Erich Honecker said in January that Soviet intermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removed ahead of schedule, but at the time he gave no specific timetable. According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22 rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practice missiles were stationed at the Waren site, which holds the largest numbers of SS-12s in East Germany. There are three other SS-12 rocket sites in the country. The city of Waren is 90 miles northwest of Berlin.", " U.S officials are in East Germany inspecting nuclear missile sites in compliance with the superpowers' Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, the state-run news agency ADN said Tuesday. ADN, in a brief report, said that two U.S. inspection teams arrived in East Germany on Monday. One team began checking a missile site near the town of Waren, about 70 miles north of Berlin the same day. The East German news agency also said the other U.S. inspection team started checking a second site Tuesday at Koenigsbrueck, about 15 miles north of Dresden. According to ADN, the Soviets maintained missiles at the sites until February, when they decided to remove them early to set a positive example in nuclear disarmament. The inspections in East Germany come as two teams of Soviet inspectors checked nuclear missile sites in Britain, which also fall under the INF agreement. Soviet teams have already conducted inspections at missile sites in West Germany and the United States this month, at the same time U.S. inspection teams began deploying to Warsaw Pact locations. The inspections fall under the terms of the INF treaty signed in Washington last Dec. 8 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan. The treaty provides for the elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with ranges from 340 miles to 3,000 miles.", " EDITOR'S NOTE - Fifty years ago Adolf Hitler decided to take his biggest gamble of World War II, the invasion of the Soviet Union. It was an action that helped lead to the collapse of the Third Reich and left the Soviet Union in control of Eastern Europe all the way to the Elbe River in central Germany. Here's a retrospective on what was going on in Berlin and Moscow during those crucial months before the invasion.", " Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday firmly rejected Moscow's suggestion that settling the military complexities of a united Germany could be delayed until after the countries are merged. ``It would be a fatal development if the external and internal conditions of German unity were not completely clear when the day of German unity comes,'' Kohl told reporters. The chancellor was referring to a suggestion by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that formal German unity could occur before ``external'' aspects of the merger are cleared up. Such ``external'' aspects would include those issues with international implications, such as the military stance of a united Germany. West Germany currently belongs to NATO, while East Germany is a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The Soviets oppose a united Germany in NATO. During reunification talks Saturday in Bonn, Shevardnadze also suggested a ``transition period'' during which the four wartime allies would retain postwar rights, even after German unity. The United States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain jointly control many matters in the former German capital of Berlin. They also have special rights outside Berlin, many involving the status of the troops they maintain in what once were their postwar military occupation zones. Shevardnadze's remarks initially triggered jubilation among some West German politicians, who sensed the pace of unification was picking up. But by Tuesday that had changed to concern about delaying settlement of important issues related to German unification. There had even been talk among some politicians of canceling West Germany's Dec. 2 national election in favor of elections for a united Germany's parliament. But Kohl said Tuesday ``without question'' the Dec. 2 elections will still occur. Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany, said Tuesday that Washington supports a united Germany with unrestricted sovereignty and without special rights for any of the World War II allied victors. ``A united Germany should have full control over its entire state territory, without any sort of new discriminating limitations of German sovereignty,'' Walters told a Frankfurt meeting of West German newspaper and broadcast susbscribers to The Associated Press. While the United States has promised it won't stand in the way of full sovereignty for a united Germany, it has also made clear it wants a merged Germany to be part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Kohl has also vowed that a united Germany will be a NATO member. Moscow has suggested as a compromise that a united Germany belong to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact until still-undefined European ``security structures'' are created. Both Washington and Bonn have said they are prepared to allow Soviet troops to remain on what is now East German territory for an interim period, but both have rejected a dual-bloc membership. East Germany also reacted negatively to Shevardnadze's weekend proposals. Government officials in East Berlin are ``skeptical'' of delaying a settlement on the international issues involved in unification, said the East German news agency ADN. Kohl said his government is hoping that the six-nation talks on unification, which began Saturday, will conclude before the end of this fall. He said the international aspects of German unification will likely be discussed at the U.S.-Soviet summit at the end of this month, and at a special NATO summit in London in July.", " An era in which even the size of a kitchen knife was once decided by foreign military powers is coming to an end in Berlin, the last occupied city of World War II. The Soviet Union's agreement to gradually remove its troops from East Germany and allow a united Germany to join NATO effectively eliminates the last major barriers to unification. It also marks the virtual end of the control the four World War II Allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ have exerted over Germany since they conquered and divided it four decades ago. Nowhere is the influence of the war more evident than in Berlin, which could become the capital of a unified Germany but still is technically under military occupation. The Four Powers have said they will relinquish their rights to Berlin immediately upon unification, which is expected in early December. While West Germany was shaped into a democracy and East Germany became a model of Soviet-style communism, the capital of the old German empire was given special status under the Four Powers Agreement after the war. Britain, France and the United States remain the supreme authority in West Berlin and can, if necessary, control the telephone and mail services and police department. West Berlin is governed by a senate that must clear matters concerning security, foreign affairs and police questions with the Allies. In practice, the Allies have permitted city authorities to govern virtually on their own for many years. Hundreds of West Berlin ordinances enacted by the Allies after World War II are still on the books, but most of these laws are not enforced. An Allied committee, advised by the city, has been meeting for the past six years to throw out many of the outmoded laws. Last year, it repealed the Allied-ordered death penalty that had been on the books in West Berlin. West Germany has never had capital punishment. In the mid-1980s, the committee repealed a law that forbid West Berliners from owning kitchen knives longer than 12 inches _ another relic from the postwar years when household knives were regarded as potential weapons. As an enclave city 110 miles inside East German territory, West Berlin is linked to the West by air corridors and autobahns. The Four Powers still control the airways to Berlin, and only their airlines can fly to the city. Even the West German airline, Lufthansa, cannot land in Berlin. But this will change once the city becomes part of a unified Germany. West Berliners are exempt from serving in the West German armed forces, and young men will likely become eligible for the draft once the city passes into the German government sphere. This would effectively end West Berlin's popularity as a haven for draft dodgers from West Germany. The Allies' postwar rights can still occasionally rankle. The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper reported Tuesday that the Allies had rejected a local government proposal to require visas for East Europeans who now can travel freely to West Berlin. But Biddy Brett Rooks, spokeswoman for the British military government, called the report ``absolutely false'' and said the Allies had made no decision on the visa requirement. Ansgar Voessing, a spokesman for the Christian Democrat delegation in the city senate, said East bloc residents need a visa to go to West Germany, but none to travel to West Berlin. He cited that as an example of how the Four Powers Agreement has led to a ``clear inequality'' in laws. East Berlin was named the capital of Communist East Germany, an action never recognized by the Western allies. In East Berlin, the Soviet Union exercised little direct administrative control over the city because of the iron-fisted rule of its surrogate, East Germany's Communist government, and the presence of 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany. ``The mayor had no power whatsoever. His sole function was to follow party directives,'' said Klaus Haetzel, spokesman for the East Berlin city council. The West German democratic constitution is as much a product of the Allies as the status of Berlin. Its system of 11 states, the nation's laws against extremism, were all drafted by the victors. In the long term, the only vestige of the war after German unification would be the Allied troops and their nuclear arsenals stationed in the country under the NATO alliance. Now that the Soviets have agreed to end their military presence on German territory in three or four years, the Western allies may be asked to withdraw some of their troops and weapons from West Germany. Demands for the removal of NATO nuclear weapons in West Germany could be the next step, according to Klaus Becher, a foreign policy analyst in Bonn. ``The West German populace favors the removal of nuclear weapons, at least offensive weapons,'' Becher said. ``Almost all political forces in Germany are especially sensitive to this.''", " Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a U.S.-Soviet treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons could be signed by January but that he will not set aside disputes over the ``Star Wars'' program to reach such an accord. The Soviet leader also said his policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness, includes freedom of speech, but he condemned a leading dissident as a ``parasite'' and accused him of ``sponging on the democratic process.'' Gorbachev's comments came in a pre-summit interview with two American news organizations. The Soviet news agency Tass on Sunday ran a partial transcript of the interview with The Washington Post and Newsweek. Radio Moscow's English-language foreign service also carried a report about it as its lead item on Sunday. Soviet television's widely watched evening news program ``Vremya'' mentioned as its lead item that the interview had been published in Washington and would appear in today's Soviet newspapers. The 90-minute discussion, in which Gorbachev also proposed a joint U.S.-Soviet trip to Mars, covered a wide range of foreign and domestic issues. The interview, conducted in the Kremlin on Wednesday, produced a startling Biblical reference by the head of the officially atheistic state. When asked about how far glasnost should go and about criticism of dictator Josef V. Stalin, the 57-year-old Communist Party leader said: ``Jesus Christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew how to feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread. We don't possess that skill, we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems quickly.'' The interview was conducted 11 days before President Reagan's arrival in Moscow for a five-day summit with Gorbachev. It will be their fourth meeting. Although the Tass transcript included much of the interview, it deleted a reference to Yegor Ligachev, the Kremlin's No. 2 man. It also left out a reference to Gorbachev's wife, Raisa. Ligachev, considered more conservative than the Soviet leader, reportedly wants to slow Gorbachev's policy of ``perestroika,'' or restructuring, of the Soviet economy and society. Gorbachev acknowledged a lively debate between the two but said ``to present these discussions _ which are a normal part of the democratic process _ as division within the leadership would be a great mistake itself.'' Gorbachev expressed optimism that a superpower agreement to cut strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons will be completed by the time Reagan leaves office in January. ``We want to have that signed,'' he said. If the agreement ``comes to be drafted under the present U.S. administration, I see no reason why President Reagan and I should not sign it. I would certainly welcome that,'' Gorbachev added. However, he cautioned that he has no plans to set aside disputes to hasten an agreement. ``If we sign with one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive forces in one area and at the same time launch an arms race in space or at sea, what would be the point? That would be senseless,'' he said. He reiterated his opposition to Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile defense program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, saying the leader who promotes an escalation of the arms race in space ``is committing a crime against the people _ his own people, and others.'' U.S. and Soviet officials have said they don't believe the long-range nuclear weapons treaty will be completed by the end of Reagan's term. Another treaty to ban short- and medium-range nuclear weapons is being debated by the U.S. Senate. Gorbachev said he will ask Reagan at the summit to approve a joint Soviet-U.S. unmanned flight to Mars. ``Why shouldn't we work together? We have great experience, you have great experience _ let us cooperate to master the cosmos, to fulfill big programs,'' he said. On domestic affairs, Gorbachev was asked whether glasnost includes freedom of speech. ``While freedom of speech is indispensable for glasnost, we see glasnost as a broader phenomenon,'' he said. Glasnost is ``the right of every citizen to openly say what he or she thinks about all social and political questions,'' he added. Gorbachev was asked later whether freedom of speech applies to dissidents such as Moscow journalist Sergei Grigoryants, who was jailed for a week earlier this month. Gorbachev said Soviets think of Grigoryants ``as some kind of alien phenomenon in our society sponging on the democratic process.'' Gorbachev went on to call Grigoryants a ``parasite.'' It was a rare reference by a Soviet leader to a dissident. Grigoryants, editor of the dissident magazine Glasnost, said the computer and printer used to produce the journal were confiscated when he was arrested. In a telephone interview on Sunday, he called Gorbachev's comments about him ``very unpleasant.''", " Here is a brief summary of forest and grassland fires active Thursday in the West:", " The Supreme Court today let stand a $3.5 million punitive-damages award won by a San Diego gas station operator against Atlantic Richfield Co. The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the award, believed to be the second largest of its kind ever upheld in California courts, is unconstitutionally excessive. John V. Nielsen had operated an ARCO station as an independent dealer for 12 years before agreeing to convert his service station to a mini-market and self-service station in 1979. His lawsuit charged ARCO with fraudulently misrepresenting facts in connection with the conversion of his station. A state court jury awarded Nielsen $525,788 in compensatory damages _ $79,061 in out-of-pocket losses, $396,727 in lost anticipated profits and $50,000 for emotional distress. The jury also awarded him $3.5 million in punitive damages against ARCO. A state appeals court upheld the award except for the emotional-distress damages, and the California Supreme Court refused to hear ARCO's appeal. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for ARCO argued that the huge punitive-damages award _ seven times the compensatory-damages award _ violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ``excessive fines.'' No court has ever applied that constitutional principle to non-criminal cases. The Supreme Court in May passed up deciding in a Mississippi case whether the constitutional ban on ``excessive fines'' can be applied to personal-injury lawsuits. Some state legislatures, reacting to soaring insurance rates, in recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in personal-injury lawsuits. Lawyers for ARCO urged the justices to ``send a clear signal that the state courts must stop these gargantuan awards.'' But lawyers for Nielsen argued that the ARCO appeal should not be granted because the oil company's lawyers had not raised the ``excessive fines'' argument in state courts. The justices refused to address the punitive-damages issue in the Mississippi case decided earlier this month after noting that it had not been raised in state courts. ARCO's appeal did not challenge the $475,000 compensatory-damages award won by Nielsen. The case is Atlantic Richfield vs. Nielsen, 87-1196.", " Washington state's automobile-lemon law, designed to protect consumers who purchase defective new motor vehicles, was upheld today by a unanimous state Supreme Court. The law had been challenged by the Ford Motor Co., which contended it violates the equal protection and due process provisions of the state and U.S. constitutions. ``The state's interest in protecting consumers in the purchase of motor vehicles under the motor vehicles warranties law outweighs the due process considerations,'' Justice Charles Smith wrote for the court. The case stemmed from Ford's appeal to the King County Superior Court of a New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board ruling in favor of Gary Barrett. Barrett bought a Ford Thunderbird from Mossy Ford in Bellevue in September 1985. He went to the arbitration board after the dealer was unable to repair a steering problem that caused the vehicle to pull to the left. The board ordered Ford to buy the vehicle back from Barrett. Ford conceded that the steering defect constituted a serious safety defect. But the automaker appealed, asking that Barrett's claim be denied on merits and contending the requirement that it repurchase the vehicle was unconstitutional. Superior Court Judge Patricia Aitken disagreed. She ordered Ford to pay Barrett $7,125, representing the repurchase cost less offset for use; $7,000 for Ford's failure to provide free use of a comparable loaner vehicle pending resolution of the appeal; and $1,750 for attorney's fees. In its appeal of tht decision to the state's high court, Ford contended that requiring it to pay attorney fees and a loaner-vehicle fee constituted the singling out of ``a class of litigants and subjecting them to onerous penalties as a condition of seeking redress within the court system.'' Ford also complained that if had prevailed in its superior court appeal, Barrett could not have been forced to pay attorney fees. The company said that represented denial of equal protection under the law for Ford and discouraged the filing of appeals. Smith noted, however, that the law designates two classes, manufacturers and consumers, and that the consumer class is not held liable for fees incurred in an appeal. Smith held that the separation of classes was rational. And he brushed aside Ford's argument that the law might discourage all appeals by manufacturers. He said Ford had not effectively demonstrated that the law was not rationally related to its purpose. ``Equal protection does not require that legislative efforts be perfect,'' Smith wrote, adding: ``The state's interest in (consumer protection) outweighs any deterrent effect on manufacturers.''", " California's civil rights commission may not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm caused by job discrimination, the state Supreme Court ruled today. The 5-2 ruling eliminates the Fair Employment and Housing Commission's ability to order damages for bias victims who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation caused by employers' mistreatment. Those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to court and sue for a full range of damages. But suits are available only to those who can afford a lawyer. The court said the commission was authorized only to order back pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination. In a separate decision today, the court said discrimination victims were not required to file claims with the state before suing in court. The rulings come three years after the court prohibited the same commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant cases of job discrimination. In that time, the Legislature has passed bills establishing the commission's authority to award both kinds of damages, but Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed them. Today's ruling was based on an interpretation of current state law and left open the possibility that the Legislature could pass a new law allowing the commission to award damages. But the opinion by Justice Edward Panelli hinted that unlimited damage awards by the commission, even if authorized by state law, might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a jury trial. A jury in a court case ``is in the best position to determine just compensation for emotional and mental distress,'' Panelli wrote. The ruling overturned a $20,000 damage award by the commission to Rose Brown, a secretary for the Peralta Community College District in Oakland. She claimed she was fired in April 1981 for refusing sexual advances by an administrator at Laney College.", " Brisbane M M M Brussels 68 50 clr Budapest 91 72 cdy B'Aires 64 54 clr Cairo M M M Calgary 77 54 cdy Caracas 84 68 cdy Copenhagen 70 66 clr Dublin 62 51 cdy Frankfurt M M M Geneva 81 61 cdy Harare 73 45 cdy Havana 89 77 clr Helsinki 75 61 cdy Hong Kong 91 81 cdy Istanbul 86 72 clr Jerusalem 86 64M Jo'burg 64 36 clr Kiev 82 63 clr Lima 63 55 cdy Lisbon 82 68 clr London 70 54 cdy Madrid 95 66 clr Manila 90 75 rn Mexico City 77 52 clr Montreal 79 61 cdy Moscow 70 55 clr Nairobi 68 55 cdy Nassau 91 82 cdy New Delhi 89 79 cdy Nicosia M M M Oslo 72 57 clr Paris 72 54 cdy Rio 91 67 rn Rome 90 64 clr San Juan 82 77 cdy Santiago 72 36 clr Sao Paulo 77 57 rn Seoul 86 64 clr Singapore 86 73 rn Stockholm 72 63 rn Sydney M M M Taipei 88 77 rn Tel Aviv 84 73M Tokyo 91 82 clr Toronto 82 64 cdy Vancouver 73 61 cdy Vienna 82 68 cdy Warsaw 82 59 clr", " The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a $550,000 award won, and then lost, by a Texas couple whose daughter was born with deformities after her mother took the anti-nausea drug Bendectin. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that overturned a jury award against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the drug's manufacturer. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd Brock of Moscow, Texas, sued Merrell Dow after their daughter, Rachel, was born with deformed limbs in 1982. A three-member panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year threw out the $550,000 judgment a federal trial jury had awarded the Brocks. The appeals court said there is no definitive scientific proof that Bendectin causes birth defects, and said the jury award was based on speculation. ``Speculation unconfirmed by ... proof cannot form the basis for causation in a court of law,'' the appeals court said. The full 5th Circuit court, by a 8-6 vote, refused to review the three-member panel's ruling. The dissenters noted that six experts testified for the Brocks that Bendectin is capable of causing birth defects, and that three testified they believed the drug caused Rachel's deformities. The dissenting judges said appellate courts should not substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury merely because medical experts disagree. Bendectin was marketed by Richardson-Merrell Inc. between 1957 and 1983. More than 30 million women used the drug during pregnancy. Richardson-Merrell later became Merrell Dow, which last July merged with Marion Laboratories Inc. and became Marion Merrell Dow Inc., based in Kansas City. The company stopped selling Bendectin 1983, although the Federal Drug Administration never has rescinded approval of it. Merrell Dow in 1984 agreed to pay $120 million to more than 800 families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused by Bendectin. As part of the settlement, the corporation did not admit that the drug caused the defects. The settlement was rejected by a federal appeals court, and the lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in Ohio, where Merrell Dow has its headquarters in Hamilton County. After a 22-day trial in 1985, an Ohio jury found that Bendectin did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses. The case acted on today is Brock vs. Merrell Dow, 89-1189.", " A federal judge approved a settlement Thursday that keeps the state from restricting abortions to women less than 18 weeks pregnant. U.S. District Judge John Nordberg agreed to the settlement between Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the American Civil Liberties Union. ``The court finds the proposed consent decree lawful, fair, reasonable and adequate,'' the judge wrote in the 13-page opinion. Anti-abortion groups opposed the settlement, calling it ``unconscionable and unconstitutional.'' Ragsdale vs. Turnock was settled Nov. 24, just days before the U.S. Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the case. It was one of several that anti-abortion groups had hoped would be used as a test case for the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The settlement permits the state to regulate abortion clinics without removing the availability of abortions to women who are less than 18 weeks pregnant. Under the agreement, access to abortions cannot be restricted by substantially increasing the cost of the procedure or reducing the number of clinics. The lawsuit was brought by Rockford physician Richard Ragsdale, who objected to regulations requiring abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like small hospitals. He said the regulation was a veiled attempt to restrict access to abortions. One of the requirements deleted from the settlement mandated that patients receive counseling about birth control and adoption and that counselors be people who wouldn't profit from abortions. The settlement also eliminated a requirement that all abortion clinics go through a public hearing process and obtain a ``certificate of need'' from the state verifying that they do not duplicate similar services in their areas.", " The Supreme Court today strengthened the right of criminal suspects to have lawyers present when they are questioned by police. By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned the murder conviction of Mississippi death row inmate Robert S. Minnick, who confessed when he was questioned without his lawyer present. The court said Minnick's rights were violated even though he earlier had consulted with his lawyer and agreed to talk to authorities. Unless the suspect initiates such a talk with police, the court said, he may not be questioned outside the presence of his lawyer once he has invoked his right to a lawyer. In other action, the court: - Left intact a lawsuit settlement that eased restrictions on abortion clinics in Illinois. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by two nurses and two expectant fathers who said the settlement does not adequately protect women or fetuses. - Refused to kill a lawsuit against a California community college's officials accused of unlawful censorship for blocking the on-campus performance of a racially charged play. The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the college officials. - Shielded businesses from some big-money lawsuits filed by employees who claim they were fired so their employers would not have to pay pension benefits. The court ruled unanimously that fired employees may not sue4 in state courts over such allegations. The state suits are pre-empted by a federal law protecting pensions, the court said. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court in the confession case, said, ``There can be no doubt that the interrogation in question was initiated by the police. It was a formal interview which (Minnick) was compelled to attend.'' ``Since (Minnick) made a specific request for counsel before the interview, the police-initiated interrogation was impermissible.'' In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the majority was ``misguided'' to discourage ``an honest confession.'' He said the ruling undermines a ``belief in either personal responsibility or the moral claim of just government to obedience.'' He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Justice David H. Souter did not take part in the case. Minnick and James ``Monkey'' Dyess escaped from Clarke County, Miss., jail in April 1986 and went looking for guns, authorities said. Police said the two men fatally shot Donald Ellis Thomas and Lamar Lafferty when the victims returned to Thomas's mobile home to find Minnick and Dyess there. Minnick was arrested in Lemon Grove, Calif., on Aug. 22, 1986. FBI agents ended their questioning of him when he asked for a lawyer. Minnick then met with an attorney who advised him not to answer any more questions. A few days later, Deputy Sheriff J.C. Denham of Clarke County flew to California and questioned Minnick. The suspect confessed, saying he shot Lafferty because Dyess was threatening to kill Minnick if he did not. Minnick was convicted in Mississippi and sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court, in upholding his conviction, said Denham's questioning of Minnick did not violate a rule the U.S. Supreme Court established in 1981. The high court barred police from questioning a suspect who has asked for a lawyer unless the suspect initiates the conversation. Today the high court extended that ruling to instances in which a suspect already has conferred with an attorney. Kennedy said the 1981 ruling is designed to prevent police from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a lawyer provided by the court's famous Miranda ruling in 1966. The threat of badgering is no less after the suspect has talked to his lawyer, Kennedy said. ``A single consultation with an attorney does not remove the suspect from persistent attempts by officials to persuade him to waive his rights or from the coercive pressures that accompany custody and that may increase as custody is prolonged,'' he said. The case is Minnick vs. Mississippi, 89-6332.", " The Supreme Court today refused to become involved in a bitter divorce dispute between jazz saxophonist Stan Getz and his wife of 32 years. The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by Monica Getz that New York's divorce law violates the rights of women. Getz, 63, sued for divorce in 1981, after Mrs. Getz, 56, went to court alleging her husband - suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction - abused her. She sought a court order for family support payments and protection against Getz. The couple later made attempts at reconciliation before the divorce became final in 1987. A state jury ruled in Getz's favor in granting the divorce. He had accused his wife of infidelity and trying to poison him. Mrs. Getz said her husband had been repeatedly unfaithful and unpredictably violent, but said she stood by him when drugs and alcohol could have cost him his life. A state judge ruled that Mrs. Getz is entitled to half her husband's royalties from the beginning of their marriage in 1956 to 1981. That ruling was not at issue in the case acted on today. In her appeal to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Getz said the divorce decree against her is unfair. She said the case should have been resolved in New York's family courts rather than by trial courts that handle corporate disputes and other matters. She said the state law favors men by permitting them to wage ``legal wars of attrition'' against their wives, who often lack equal financial resources. Family courts are designed to expedite resolutions of divorce cases and spare the couple excessive legal fees, she said. Mrs. Getz said she has spent more than $600,000 in legal fees and will be forced to use the proceeds from the couple's mansion in Irvington, N.Y., where she still lives, to pay off the bills. In a legal brief in her behalf, Mrs. Getz's lawyer, Whitney North Seymour Jr., said, ``The wife's entire life has been left in shambles by this case. She has been branded an adulteress. She has become obligated to pay legal fees of many hundreds of thousands of dollars. She is being forced out of her home and to give up her old-age security.'' The case is Getz vs. Getz, 90-562.", " The Supreme Court today reinstated a $6.1 million award against the Arthur Young & Co. accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer's Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that the promissory notes held by the co-op's investors are ``securities'' as defined by federal law. A federal appeals court had thrown out the award after ruling that the notes were not securities. Sold for many years by the co-op to thousands of farmers, the notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest. When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about 1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more than $10 million. Among other legal actions, investors filed a ``class action'' lawsuit against Arthur Young & Co., which had audited the co-op's 1981 and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those statements. The suit alleged that the accounting firm fraudulently had misled investors about the co-op's financial strength, in violation of a federal security law's anti-fraud provisions. A federal jury awarded the investors about $6.1 million in compensatory damages, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award when ruling that the notes were not securities. In disagreeing with the 8th Circuit court, Justice Thurgood Marshall noted ``Congress' broader purpose ... of ensuring that investments of all descriptions be regulated to prevent fraud and abuse.'' He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented. The case is Reves vs. Ernst and Young, 88-1480.", " Relatives or guardians of brain-damaged people can order the removal of feeding tubes that keep them alive, the Florida Supreme Court said in a ruling hailed by ``right-to-die'' advocates. ``It reaffirms the rights of Floridians under our (state) constitution to make their own decisions about what will be done with their bodies,'' said Charlene Carres, a Tallahassee attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. Roman Catholics, anti-abortion groups and other opponents did not immediately respond, saying they needed more time to review the ruling. The decision focused on an elderly woman who died last summer. Estelle Browning spent the last 2{ years of her life hooked up to feeding tubes that she had specified in a ``living will'' she didn't want. Mrs. Browning suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and was left in a persistent vegetative state, unable to swallow or communicate. She was not comatose. Doris Herbert, Mrs. Browning's second cousin and only living relative, was named her guardian. Herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988. The state fought the request and a trial court denied it, but a state appeals court said the Florida Constitution allowed for removal of the tubes and the issue was reviewed by the Supreme Court. ``We hold that, because Mrs. Browning was unable to exercise her constitutional right of privacy by reason of her medical condition, her guardian was authorized to exercise it for her,'' Justice Rosemary Barkett wrote. When people take ``the time and trouble'' to write ``living wills,'' express their wishes orally or appoint health-care surrogates, there's no need to go before a judge to get permission to carry out their wishes, the court ruled. Patricia Dore, a law professor at Florida State University who drafted the privacy clause added to the state constitution in 1980, said it was significant that the justices ruled there was no legal distinction between food and water supplied through tubes and other medical treatments, like respirators. Although it has no direct impact outside Florida, attorneys and advocates said other state courts could be influenced by the case. ``I think many, many state courts look to Florida for guidance on issues that affect the elderly,'' said George Felos, an attorney who represented Herbert. Florida's high court heard oral arguments in the case in January. Six months later, the U.S. Supreme Court said a Missouri couple could not order the removal of food and water keeping their 32-year-old comatose daughter alive. The daughter, Nancy Cruzan, had not left a living will. Her parents said they were certain she would prefer to die rather than live in a coma. In its split decision, the nation's high court said competent people have a right to refuse medical treatment.", " Today's 17th game of the Garry Kasparov-Anatoly Karpov world chess championship has been postponed until Wednesday at Kasparov's request. The two Soviet grandmasters are scheduled to resume the 16th game on Tuesday. That game was contested for five hours Saturday and nearly six hours Sunday without a result after 88 moves. Through the 15 completed games, the players are tied with 7.5 points each. They have had three draws in the French portion of the championship. They had 10 draws in the 12 games played at New York between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7. The first player to reach 12.5 points wins the championship, but Kasparov would retain the title in the event of a 12-12 draw. Each player is allowed to request up to three postponements during the championship. The postponement requested by Kasparov today was his second.

The first two nights of the Olympics, Saturday and Sunday, varied widely in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, but according to ABC averaged higher than the first two nights of the 1984 games. An estimated 25 million viewers saw Sunday night's coverage, featuring pairs figure skating, putting it in the top 10 with a 19.7 rating and a 30 share. But Saturday's coverage of hockey was in the bottom 10 with a 9.9 rating and 17 share. The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use that are tuned to that program. The first two nights of the 1984 games were a Tuesday and a Wednesday, and had a combined rating of 13.8 compared to 15.5 for this year, said ABC. ABC's highest rated show of the week wasn't the Olympics, but the conclusion of the two-part miniseries ``Elvis and Me,'' the highest-rated miniseries so far this season. But NBC handily won the week ending Feb. 14, with an average prime-time rating of 16.2. ABC was second with 14.9. CBS was third with 14.2. After winning 19 of the 21 weeks so far in the season, NBC has an average rating of 16.4, and CBS and ABC are tied with 13.6. The 10 top-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``Elvis and Me, Part 2'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Growing Pains'' ABC, ``Night Court'' NBC, ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC and the Winter Olympics Sunday coverage on ABC. NBC's new ``Sonny Spoon,'' starring Mario Van Peebles as a chameleon private eye, premiered last Friday with so-so numbers, ranking 49th. The lowest rated shows of the week were: ``Our House,'' Winter Olympics Saturday coverage, ``West 57th,'' ``The Law and Harry McGraw,'' ``Decision '88 _ The Iowa Caucus,'' ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ``The Thorns,'' ``48 Hours in Israel,'' ``Sledge Hammer!'' and ``The Charmings.'' For the week ending Feb. 12, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had an average rating of 11.8 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had an 11.1 and 19. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.9 and 19. Network analysts had no immediate explanation for ABC's showing. However, last week's ratings could have been affected by coverage of the Iowa caucuses, the first results from the 1988 presidential race. ``We tend to do well with major stories, be it Challenger or coverage of Chernobyl, and with live programming like the Iran hearings and political coverage,'' said ABC News spokeswoman Elise Adde. ABC's prime-time special on Iowa ranked a respectable 44 out of 68. It followed the conclusion of ``Elvis and Me.'' NBC's Iowa coverage ranked 63rd. CBS delayed its coverage of Iowa until 11:30 p.m. EST, after prime time. The last time ABC was first in news ratings was the week of Aug. 10, 1987.", " It's too early to tell how NBC's 179 hours of prime-time Summer Olympics coverage will score in the ratings, but the first three nights started far off the ratings record set by the 1984 games on ABC. Nevertheless, the first three nights of coverage did land in the top 10 in the Nielsens last week, the final week of the broadcast year. Sunday night's Olympics coverage was No. 2 among all prime-time shows, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co., with a rating of 17.7 and a 30 share. Saturday's coverage came in ninth, with a rating of 16.1 and a 31 share. The opening ceremonies Friday ranked 10th, with a 15.2 and 29. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The 1984 games averaged a 23.5 rating. People meters, the new viewer-measuring devices that have shown overall lower numbers for network shows, combined with a decline in network viewing may contribute to a depression in Olympics ratings this year. The first three nights of the Olympics averaged about a 30 share, somewhat lower than the third of the viewing audience NBC had predicted. NBC analyst Jeff Boehme said it was too early to tell if there's a trend in the Olympics ratings. Monday night's Olympics broadcast continued to score disappointingly in the ratings, though it won the night for NBC. The coverage during prime time rated 18.0 with a 28 share. CBS had a 14.5 for the night, and ABC a 12.9. CBS effectively programmed against the Olympics on Sunday night with a repeat of the Valerie Bertinelli movie ``Rockabye'' that ranked fourth in the Nielsens. CBS also scored with its timely ``48 Hours'' on the approach of Hurricane Gilbert, getting the highest rating yet for the weekly news program. It ranked 12th with a 14.1 rating and 24 share. NBC won the week ending Sept. 18 with an average rating of 14.0. CBS and ABC tied with 11.5 each. The week marked the 52nd since the 1987-88 fall season began, so NBC claimed its fourth broadcast-year win in a row with an average rating of 14.5. Although CBS finished third for the regular season that ended in April, based on yearlong figures, CBS edged ABC for the broadcast year with an average rating of 12.2 to ABC's 12.1. The top 10 shows last week were: ``A Different World'' NBC, ``Summer Olympics _ Sunday'' NBC, ``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Rockabye'' CBS, ``Monday Night Football'' ABC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``Barbara Walters'' ABC, ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS, ``Summer Olympics _ Saturday'' and ``Summer Olympics _ Opening'' NBC. The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``Live! Dick Clark Presents,'' ``The Flintstones _ Just Say No,'' ``The `Slap' Maxwell Story,'' ``Cowboy Joe,'' ``California Girls Special,'' ``Lily Tomlin _ Sold Out,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Live from the Hard Rock Cafe,'' ``Space _ Beyond the Shuttle'' and ``Decision '88 Countdown.'' Despite a move to a half-hour earlier in New York, where its ratings dropped, the ``CBS Evening News'' rebounded into first place in the national news ratings after tying with ABC's ``World News Tonight'' the previous week. The news race last week continued to be a virtual dead heat, with less than a point separating the three network newscasts. CBS had a 10.8 rating and 22 share, ABC had 10.3 and 21, and ``NBC Nightly News'' had a rating of 10.1 and a 20 share.", " Two new situation comedies starring Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, respectively, are gone from CBS' schedule, the network announced Tuesday in a schedule shakeup that dumps two of the three CBS shows produced by Grant Tinker's GTG Entertainment. The network, which has ranked last in the ratings so far this season, said ``Annie McGuire,'' starring Miss Moore, would have its last broadcast in its Wednesday time period on Dec. 28, suggesting it might be brought back in the future. But the network said ``The Van Dyke Show'' and ``Raising Miranda,'' the GTG shows, would have their final broadcasts this month. ``Dirty Dancing,'' a half-hour show based on the hit movie of the same name will go ``on hiatus'' in January. ``Simon & Simon,'' the long-running, on-again, off-again detective series, has its last broadcast in its Saturday time period on Dec. 31. CBS left the door open to reviving it yet again. GTG Entertainment was established by former NBC chairman and MTM Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett. Tinker founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Mary Tyler Moore. The third GTG show for CBS, the critically praised ``TV101,'' an hourlong, teen-appeal drama, is being moved next month from its low-rated Tuesday time slot to Wednesday in place of the Moore and Van Dyke shows. GTG has also not fared well with its only other current TV enterprise, the syndicated newsmagazine show ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' though the company insists it is sticking by that show for the long haul. In the most recent ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co., ``Annie McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' were the lowest-rated network shows of the week. ``Raising Miranda'' was the third lowest-rated show last week. Both ``Annie McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' had problems from the start. Both pilots were re-shot and the Moore show was partially recast. They then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever. Moore and Van Dyke co-starred in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960s, and Moore starred as Mary Richards in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' in the 1970s. CBS announced that ``Tour of Duty,'' a Vietnam series, will return to the schedule Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST. ``Dolphin Cove,'' starring Frank Converse as a dolphin researcher in Australia, will join the schedule in January in place of ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Raising Miranda'' on Saturday night. The Smothers Brothers will also return to the schedule for four shows in January and February.", " ABC's ``Roseanne'' edged NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' as prime-time ratings champ in the just-concluded 1989-1980 season, NBC announced Monday. ABC's Tuesday comedy starring Roseanne Barr averaged a 23.3 rating, two-tenths of a ratings point more than the Bill Cosby family comedy which has been first in the Nielson ratings for the last four seasons. ``The Cosby Show,'' wound up in second place for the season. Cosby's series has been on the air for six seasons, and Barr's series for two. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. Final figures for the 30-week season, which ended Sunday, won't be available until Tuesday. But network research analysts say that NBC will easily win its fifth consecutive season, with ABC coming in second, and once-dominant CBS in third place for the third straight season. Still awaiting final figures for the last three days of the season, Preston Beckman, NBC vice-president for research, said that NBC thus far had a 14.6 ratings average, ABC a 12.9 and CBS a 12.2 during the season. NBC's ratings are down by nine percent, ABC's are flat, and those of CBS are down by three percent, he said. He cited competition from cable, the fledgling Fox network, and independent stations as factors in the overall ratings drop. However, he attributed 25 percent of NBC's decline to the absence of three sports events it had in prime time during the previous season _ the Summer Olypmics, the World Series and pro football's Superbowl.", " Hubert de Givenchy wound up an exciting week of summer haute couture with a parade of his gala couture clothes for women who want to look on the sexy side. Spanish-born Paco Rabanne won the Golden Thimble Award for his amusing, lively collection that made full use of ``new'' materials like fringed raffia, crystal-globe embroideries and sequined leather. Two-time winner Christian Lacroix finished a close second in the semiannual prize awarded by an international jury of fashion journalists. Givenchy's show, on Thursday, was magnificent. From caramel leather shorts topped by fresh and airy white linen blouses to the most extravagantly opulent evening wear, the show ranked as one of best this master of the fine art of couture has ever produced. His narrow rustic linen suits or belted knee-revealing dresses in shades of bright blue, rust, peach, and golden sand with their bold silver buttons couldn't be faulted for daytime. Givenchy brought out plenty of trouser suits, tailored in soft gabardines or shiny linen tweeds. He solved the dilemma of see-through chiffon blouses with a white-dotted transparent black number sporting a big floppy bow to hide bosom details. The sharp Givenchy silhouette with padded shoulders in suits was softened up with considerable sexiness for late-day wear. Even the bridal number was barely more than a sprig of pastel silk flowers on a prancing nude. But the main elements of style were there. Almost every evening outfit was a show-stopper. His enormous-flowered gazar and organza evening gowns were breathtaking. The fabrics featured bold poppies, daisies, lilies of the valley or daffodils on hot-colored backgrounds of kelly green, citron, tomato, purple or fuchsia. Some white faille bustier gowns with black-lace embroidery glowing with siren-red chiffon or affeta wraps were dynamite, guaranteeing a grand entrance. Valentino, who has shown luxury ready-to-wear for 10 years in Paris, has finally abandoned Italy as a showcase, choosing a Trocadero museum auditorium for his second Paris couture show. On Wednesday night, he brought out a dazzling show of glamorous clothes for rich women, the outfits looking particularly light and young. He led off and ended with swingy, short clothes in his original signature color of white, suits cut with longer jackets and short skirts, waves of accordion pleats around for dancing skirts. Otherwise, Valentino spiced the show with lots of his favorite hot reds and soft tones like celdadon, wisteria, peach and silvery gray in the softest of fabrics like cashmere, silk crepe and acres of flounced chiffon _ a Paris must for couture. Valentino used a lot of tricky latticework in his late-day toppers and the sumptuous evening wear included all kinds of elaborate draping, pleated transparent capes, sequined pastille embroideries on chiffon, and tiers of lace. Per Spook as usual went his own way in a simplified, sporty view of couture that has nothing to do with pretension or grandiose entrances. Except for a few charming buttoned jersey short shift dresses, he seemed allergic to leggy looks. His trouser outfits were cut a bit baggy around the ankle and he often topped these with cute layered styles from a bustier top to a blouse-jacket. But if the 1990s are going to be full of color and feminine clothes as most couturiers seem to think, Spook's best contributions are in some of his bright print sporty toppers and adorable evening wear.", " Claude Monet's Impressionist painting of his wife in a meadow became the third highest priced work at auction Tuesday, going for $24.59 million to an anonymous telephone bidder, Sotheby's said. The price for ``Dans La Prairie'' (``In the Meadow'') broke the record for a Monet set 24 hours earlier at Christie's, which sold his painting of a blue house for $6.55 million, also to an anonymous telephone bidder. The two sales of Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture by the rival firms totaled nearly $123.5 million. Sotheby's also sold a Monet landscape for $2 million and set a record price for Pierre Bonnard, whose painting of a woman in her bath fetched $3.78 million. A picture of two women musicians by Henri Matisse sold for $2.83 million. Only one buyer of works realizing more than 1 million pounds ($1.72 million) was identified: Japan's Fujii Gallery paid $2.17 million for Pierre-Auguste Renoir's portrait of a young woman in a yellow hat. ``The picture of his wife was Monet's most important work to appear on the market for 20 years,'' said Sotheby's expert, Michel Strauss. ``There was ferocious bidding which lasted for five minutes between two people on the telephone and no one in the saleroom appeared to be bidding while it was going on,'' said Fiona Ford, Sotheby's spokeswoman. Auctioneer Julian Barran opened the bidding at $6.8 million after Sotheby's had estimated the picture to be worth around $10.3 million. The highest auction prices have been paid for flower paintings by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. His ``Irises'' sold to an anonymous buyer at Sotheby's in New York last November for $53.9 million. Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was bought by a Japanese insurance company at Christie's in London in March 1987 for $39.85 million. Monet, a Frenchman known as the father of Impressionism and the greatest master of that style, painted his wife in 1876 when they were living at Argenteuil near Paris. The summery picture depicts Camille in a white dress and hat, with a parasol behind her, reading a book as she lies among tall grass and wild flowers. The picture was sold by trustees of the estate of the late David David-Weill, an art collector who bought it about 1938 in Paris from the art dealers, Wildenstein.", " The 22nd and possibly decisive game of the world chess championship between defender Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov was postponed a second time, the organizers announced Sunday. A technical time-out was called so the game would not be played on Monday, Christmas Eve. Karpov took his third and final time-out on Saturday, pushing the 22nd game to Monday. Kasparov has used all his time-outs. With Christmas approaching, the president of the International Federation of Chess, Florencio Campomanas, reached an agreement with both players to put off the 22nd game until Wednesday. Regulations permit a technical time-out. Kasparov leads the series 11.5 to 9.5 and needs only a draw to gain the 12 points needed to win and retain the title. He will play white in the 22nd game, with Karpov defending with the black pieces. Kasparov has won the last three times he has played white in the nine games in Lyon. Karpov needs to win the final three games to take the title. He has won twice in the 21 previous games of this series. The two have played to a draw five times in the French portion of the championship. They drew 10 times in the 12 games played in New York between Oct. 8 and Nov. 7. Even if Kasparov clinches the title by reaching 12 points in the series, the two Soviet grandmasters will continue playing to see who wins the majority of the $3 million purse. If the overall series ends in a 12-12 draw, the prize money will be split. Kasparov won the title from Karpov in 1985 and defended it in 1986 and 1987. Karpov took the championship in 1975 when American Bobby Fischer refused to defend the title he won in 1972.", " The crowd gave Yves Saint Laurent a standing ovation for his colorful couture show on Wednesday, which featured his flawless tailoring and technique, and his daring use of color. It's hard to imagine anybody else sustaining such interest through a series of 25 tuxedo suits. Each one was perfection, whether with short skirts, long skirts, long pants, spencers or long jackets with white satin wing lapels or black kimono lapels. The sparkly vineyard embroideries with bunches of grapes plastered onto bolero jackets and necklines of satin cocktail suits and evening gowns nearly brought the house down. The show in the Intercontinental Hotel ballroom attracted celebrity clients including first lady Danielle Mitterrand, Paloma Picasso, film star Catherine Deneuve and American socialite Lynn Wyatt. ``It was terrific, like watching an artist at work,'' said Liza Minnelli. ``His clothes are works of art. It's like going to a museum.'' The suits were classics, wearable anywhere. Shoulders were amply padded but not offensively so. Besides his favorite short and straight skirt, Saint Laurent has adopted another shape and length: a longer length to just below the knee, flared or pleated below the hip. Daytime trousers looked straightforward and sporty, although they could be dressed up by one of the mink or ruddy fox coats, or a taffeta coat, another great Saint Laurent item for winter. With raglan or puffed sleeves, these superb taffeta numbers sometimes had bright, contrasting linings. Saint Laurent's use of zingy color was a far cry from his sober looks of past seasons. Cerise and pink teamed often for day or evening, and brightly piped suede suits came on in turquoise and rust, red and green, rust and navy. It was a huge show _ 134 outfits _ and just about everything was totally elegant and wearable, from the beautiful Chanel-style dresses with touches of white and gold buttons to the marvelously draped chiffons with a feminine high-waisted look to emphasize the bust. Guy Laroche went colorful as well. The double-breasted cafe au lait smooth wool suit was excellently tailored and shown with a bright orange satin blouse. A violet leather fitted jacket with brown mink shawl collar and cuffs over a lean tobacco short skirt made a perfect dressy daytime outfit. Laroche used an original touch in some of the day and evening wear: Chinese-lantern puffs on the sleeves. Some of the evening wear was appealing, especially the beaded and embroidered black dresses. But short evening gowns with puffy skirts and plenty of fancy touches looked young and fussy. Lecoanet-Hemant, a youthful pair of designers celebrating their 10th haute couture season, showed they have all the technique it takes to make couture. But it seems a shame to waste so much fabulous fabric and detail on what sometimes ends up looking more like abstract sculpture than clothes. Topped by spiraling hats, the dresses and suits with tiny skirts, enormous stand-out basque bottoms on jackets, huge cone-shaped tops sometimes looked overladen with details, and too zany for comfort. Nevertheless, the miniskirts, draped and ``laced'' through rhinestone loops, the exotic cut-out patterns and the superb satins and rich Indian fabrics were well worth looking at, if hard to wear. Paco Rabanne also seems to concentrate more on showy art objects than clothes, and aptly showed at the Decorative Arts wing of the Louvre. He is famous for his chain-mail effects, and obliged an audience eager to be entertained. Rabanne's sequined dresses, too, were larger than life, often dazzling in all colors of the rainbow, reflected prism-like from the sequins. Not everything was impractical. Rabanne also showed some very attractive rubber raincoats and a good-looking reversible rubber bolero lined with sequins worn with a black corduroy jumpsuit.", " The following are the most popular videocassettes as they appear in next week's issue of Billboard magazine.

Yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound estate plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate. Still more don't know the principles behind assessing their estate. But by better understanding how the federal government governs estate taxes, people may avoid or reduce the future federal tax liabilities. This tax savings can preserve assets in the estate that otherwise might be used to pay death taxes. These assets then may be passed on to a spouse, children, or charity. There are several steps to take in evaluating your estate. First, determine the nature and the value of your estate's assets. Assts may include: your residence, other property such as a vacation home, household furnishings, savings bonds, stocks, checking and savings accounts, pension benefits, life insurance policies, automobiles. For federal tax purposes, there are several exceptions to determining the value of an asset: - For jointly owned assets held by spouses, only half the value of the asset is included in your estate if you are the first spouse to die. - For life insurance policies, the amount included in your estate is the face amount of the policy rather than its replacement cost or present cash value (if whole life) at the date of your death. - If you die before retirement, you receive none of your pension. However, half the value of the pension is payable to your spouse and half the vested plan benefits - what would have been available to you had you lived to retirement - are included in your gross estate. - Finally, Series EE bonds are included at their present value when they mature. - All other assets generally are included at fair market value. Second, determine your deductions when calculating federal estate tax. Include funeral expenses, costs of the last illness of the decendent, if applicable; unpaid debts and mortgages; and administrative expenses for the estate. You'll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets transferred outside of the probate. To avoid probate, you may set up a living trust, although it will create some trust administration costs. In addition, property held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant outside the probate process. Other property of a contractual nature - such as life insurance policies or qualified pension plans - also will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate. Step three, determine which property qualifies for the marital deduction or charitable deduction. Three factors make a difference: - If your will transfers property to your spouse, this property qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any property is held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the property passes to the surviving spouse and qualifies for the marital deduction. - If any life insurance or qualified pension plan names your spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary, this, too, qualifies. The same kinds of arrangements will qualify property for the charitable estate tax deduction if property is left to the charity as a result of a will, a specific property designation such as a joint tenancy, or a contractual benificiary designation. Any property qualifying for the marital deduction or the charitable deduction is not subject to federal estate tax liability. Remaining property is referred to as the taxable estate. The fourth, and final, step is to determine estimated federal tax liability on the taxable estate. The unified estate and gift transfer tax rates apply to the taxable estate when calculating the amount of federal estate tax. Every individual, regardless of the size of his or her estate, is entitled to a unified credit of $192,800 that absorbs, dollar for dollar, the amount of that individual's federal estate tax liability up to that amount. This assumes that you did not make any lifetime gifts to an individual in any one year while alive that exceeded the amount of the gift tax annual exclusion amount of $10,000. Here, a rule of thumb applies. For your federal estate tax liability to be greater than $192,800, your taxable estate must be greater than $600,000. As long as a husband and wife each hold $600,000 in separately owned assets, the couple can own a total of $1.2 million in assets and the entire amount for both estates avoids federal estate tax liability. The process of rearranging property ownership for estate assets, so that each spouse's estate takes maximum advantage is known as ``estate equalization.'' Many people assume they won't have assets exceeding $600,000, but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension plans or life insurance policies, estates are often of surprising size. --- EDITOR'S NOTE - Paul Lochray is an academic associate in the estate planning division of the College for Financial Planning in Denver.", " The federal fund that insures deposits in commercial banks could suffer a loss in 1988 for the first time in its 54-year history, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said Monday. Seidman said a loss to the insurance fund, if any, would depend on how much the FDIC spends to resolve the problems of First RepublicBank of Dallas, which earlier this month received a $1 billion infusion of government aid. The deterioration of Texas banks, hard hit by losses on real estate and energy loans, has raised concern about the health of the insurance fund, which backs deposits of up to $100,000 in 13,700 commercial banks. Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Seidman said it is too soon to say with certainty what the cost of restoring First RepublicBank to health will be. But, he said the $5 billion to $6 billion estimates of some are ``far higher than anything that is likely to be required.'' He said the $1.7 billion cost of the 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co., which was about the same size as First RepublicBank, ``is the best guide we have.'' The FDIC's initial outlay on First RepublicBank could be higher than the ultimate cost, just as it was in the case of Continental when the agency spent $4.5 billion, Seidman said. However, he said the FDIC now usually tries to structure bank rescues so that the initial cash cost is close to the ultimate cost. If the First RepublicBank cost is in the $1.7 billion range and if banks fail this year at about the same rate as last year, then ``it is possible we will have a loss in 1988,'' he said. Last year, a post-Depression record of 184 banks failed. Forty-four have failed so far this year and Seidman said he expected the 1988 total to be roughly the same as 1987. As failures have increased, the steady growth of the FDIC fund _ from $4.6 billion in 1970, $11.6 billion in 1980 to $17.9 billion in 1985 _ has slowed. The fund finished 1986 with $18.2 billion and 1987 with $18.3 billion. Seidman said the 1988 loss, if it occurs, would be ``something under 5 percent ... certainly under ... $1 billion.'' He said he did not see any prospect for what he termed a substantial loss, one approaching 20 percent, or about $3.5 billion. He contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the FDIC fund with that of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits in 3,170 savings institutions. FSLIC was insolvent until last fall when money began flowing from congressionally-authorized bond sales. It has had to keep bankrupt S&Ls open because it lacked the money to pay off depositors.", " Here are some highlights of the catastrophic health insurance legislation approved Wednesday by a House-Senate conference committee: HOSPITAL _ Expands full coverage from maximum of 59 days a year to 364 days. A ``first-day'' deductible will continue to be required. DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of ``reasonable and proper'' doctor bills after an annual deductible is met. The deductible, yet to be precisely determined, will be from $1,320 and $1,400. Medicare continues to pay 80 percent of charges, with the 20 percent not now covered counting toward the annual deductible for the catastrophic benefit. DRUGS _ Medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after a $600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. Medicare pays 60 percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter, with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage. COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficaries. Current Part B premium of $24.80 to increase by about $4 a month in 1989. By 1993, the ``catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $10.20, in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time. More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by an additional ``supplemental'' premium that is linked to federal income tax liability. The supplemental is estimated at $22 a year per $150 of tax liability in 1989, rising to $42 a year per $150 of tax liability in 1993.", " The Federal Home Loan Bank Board today announced a record $1.35 billion cash payout to shut down two insolvent savings institutions in Costa Mesa, Calif. The bank board, which regulates 3,150 S&Ls, said it will begin on Tuesday to pay off deposits up to the insurance limit of $100,000 in the North America Savings and Loan Association and the American Diversified Savings Bank. M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said it was the largest cash payout ever for the agency. It is paying $1.14 billion from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to American Diversified depositers and $209 million to North America depositers. After recovering some of its costs by selling the institutions' assets, the bank board expects ultimately to spend $931 million _ $798 million for American Diversified and $133 million for North America. Depositers who had funds above the insurance limit will share in the liquidation proceeds. Both institutions share the same headquarters and have been insolvent for some time. Prior to the closing in Costa Mesa, the largest payout was $300 million in 1984 to close the Empire Savings and Loan of Mesquite, Texas. However, bank board officials expect the cost of several previous bailout packages eventually to be higher than the cost of closing the two thrifts in Costa Mesa. Last month, the bank board said it was paying $2 billion in assistance _ in the form of notes and guarantees, none of it in cash _ to the Southwest Savings Association in Dallas to take over four ailing institutions. In November, it announced a $1.3 billion bailout of Vernon Savings and Loan in Dallas, $200 million of it in cash. The rest of the assistance came in the form of notes. Wall said the bank board prefers to pay a healthier institution to take over insolvent thrifts because it is cheaper for the insurance fund. But in this case, he said the two S&Ls had little value as going concerns because they lacked retail deposits and branch offices. Instead, they relied on high-cost, short-term deposits arranged through brokers. Wall hailed today's closings as the opening of a second front in the board's drive to remove institutions that have been driving up the cost of funds for all institutions. The first front is Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, which have the largest concentration of ailing thrifts. In order to attract money, North America had to offer an average deposit rate of 8.53 percent, 1.45 percentage points above the average for all thrift institutions. American Diversified was paying 8.64 percent, 1.56 percentage points higher than the average. ``So today we march forward in our drive to remove from the marketplace those high-rate-paying insolvent thrifts,'' Wall said in a statement. The bank board attributed the failure of North America, which was chartered in 1983, to ``unsafe and unsound'' business practices. It said the association grew rapidly by aggressively soliciting high-cost jumbo certificates of deposit that were then invested in high-risk real estate loan participations and time-sharing investments. It had been in the bank board's management consignment program since January 1987. A month after that, the insurance fund sued Janet McKenzie, executive assistant to the chairman, for $40 million. As of March 31, North America had $98.2 miilion in assets and $215.7 million in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $1.59 million a month. American Diversified, orginally chartered in 1980 as Tokay Savings and Loan Association, had been in the management consignment program since February 1986. FSLIC has filed suit against Ranhir Sahni, who in 1983 led the association into what it called an ``explosive growth policy.'' It is seeking $60 million, charging fraud, negligence and racketeering. As of March 31, American Diversified had $509 million in assets and $1.12 billion in liabilities. It was losing an estimated $8.3 million a month. Depositers may present their claims either in person through June 24 or by mail. The bank board said depositors will receive the necessary forms in the mail. Questions can be directed to FSLIC at 1-800-347-6660. More than 500 of the nation's federally insured savings institutions are insolvent. The bank board says it is too soon to tell if it has enough money to resolve the cases of all 500, but it says it has enough to resolve the 200 worst cases. Last year Congress authorized the board to raise up to $10.8 billion by selling bonds over the next three years, providing the agency with total revenue of about $20 billion. However, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigating arm, estimates the cost of the cleanup at $26 billion to $36 billion. Some private analysts estimate the price tag at more than $50 billion.", " The government is losing billions of dollars in tax revenues each year because the Internal Revenue Service does not use an enforcement program on business taxpayers that it has been using effectively on individuals, a House panel said Monday. A report from the House Government Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs estimated that between $3.2 billion and $8 billion a year in taxes on interest and dividends earned by businesses is never collected because the income is not reported to the IRS. While the revenue loss estimates ``are not statistically precise,'' the report said they provide ample justification for the IRS to include businesses in the document-matching program it now uses to verify interest and dividend earnings on individual tax returns. Under the existing document-matching program, the IRS compares ``information returns'' detailing interest and dividend payments to individuals with the individuals' actual income tax returns. The program in fiscal 1985 produced $2.35 billion in additional tax revenue from individuals. Although banks and corporations are not required to file such information returns on income payments to corporations, the House report said the IRS received _ but never used _ 26 million such returns in 1985, showing income payments to 5 million businesses totaling $987 billion. ``By casting these information returns aside, IRS is not only missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than individuals,'' said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee. IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen the House report and will have no comment until agecny officials can review it. But at a hearing before Barnard's subcommittee last year, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the costs of implementing a document-matching program for corporations would not be justified by the additional revenue that would be generated. Gibbs said the administrative costs of a document-matching program for corporations would be much higher than for individuals because corporations use different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different names. Although the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain to the way income is reported'' to the IRS, the House report said the IRS ``never considered the desirably of modifying the reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial document-matching program encompassing those corporations to which the difficulties do not pertain.'' Gibbs told the subcommittee last year the IRS would begin using document-matching to verify income reported on tax returns from single-owner businesses and would initiate a multi-year study to determine the extent of business underreporting of interest and dividend income. He also promised to begin a test program using information returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do not file any income tax return. The House report said the test program in one district office was so effective the IRS now has expanded it to nine more districts and could have a document-matching program ready by next spring to identify non-filers among corporations and partnerships nationwide. But despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS ``has not been sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated computer matching capabilities to businesses.'' ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and every one of their returns will be scrutinized by IRS' computers for unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership returns are being excused from this automatic examination process,'' Barnard said. The report said Congress should help the IRS set up a document-matching program for corporate returns by enacting legislation to require that businesses and financial institutions report to the IRS all dividend and interest payments to corporations. Barnard introduced such legislation earlier this year, but it was never reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee.", " Farmers who received some government information late have been given additional time to file their 1987 federal income-tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service said Monday it was granting special relief to farmers who did not receive Agriculture Department documents by the Feb. 15 scheduled date. Those documents are Form 1099-G, which reflects certain government payments, and Form 1099-A, on which acquisitions or abandonments of secured property are reported. Farmers generally are not subject to penalties for underpayments if they file their returns by March 1. The IRS concluded that farmers who failed to receive required information from the Agriculture Department by Feb. 15 might be unable to meet the March 1 deadline. The IRS said farmers affected by the delay should attach to their tax return a Form 2210F on which they have written their name and Social Security number and, on the bottom right, the words ``farm waiver.'' With the extension, farmers will have to file returns and pay any tax owed by April 15, the deadline for most taxpayers.", " Here at a glance are the developments in the Persian Gulf crisis for the of October 14 to October 21:", " Here is look at the forces buildup in the Persian Gulf region. In line with Pentagon practice, the numbers of U.S. aircraft or troops arriving in the gulf are imprecise, as are their locations.", " Iran was carrying out what were described as its biggest military maneuvers ever, and spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today ordered armed forces to be ready for any eventuality in the Persian Gulf. Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khamenei addressed ranking military officers taking part in the air-sea exercises, code-named Piroozi 1, or ``Victory 1.'' Iran has spoken strongly against the presence of foreign military troops in the gulf region confronting Iraq, and Khamenei referred to them as ``the enemy forces.'' He said Iranian military preparedness was important because its enemies are ``armed to the teeth.'' Iran stands ready to confront any unexpected situation in the region, he said. Iran fought a 1980-88 war with Iraq, but Iraqi President Saddam Hussein made concessions for peace after his armies invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The Iranian maneuvers appeared to present no conflict with the U.S.-led multinational force because they were taking place near Iran's southern islands, far from where the ships of the multinational force are deployed. The maneuvers reportedly began Wednesday, but were not mentioned in the Iranian media until today. The radio said the destroyer Sabalan, which was rebuilt after being severely damaged in March 1988 by the U.S. fleet protecting merchant ships in the gulf, was launched by Khamenei. The rebuilt destroyer will be taking part in the war games, the radio said. It did not provide other details about the maneuvers. The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said last month that the 10-day exercises would cover 12,000 square miles in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, and involve 50 warships. Several helicopters and hundreds of speedboats were also taking part, IRNA said. The news agency had earlier described the maneuvers as the biggest war games ever conducted by Iran. IRNA said the maneuvers would include amphibious operations and landings, rescue of ``captured'' ships and underwater rescue of frogmen. Weapons to be used included surface-to-surface missiles and air-to-surface missiles, IRNA reported in November. Smaller naval exercises have been conducted by Iran since the Kuwait invasion. The dominant Islamic Republic Guards Corps, which has its own air, military and naval wings, and Iran's regular armed forces, have often been in involved in disputes. Such internal strife was to blame for a string of military defeats in the Iran-Iraq war, which finally forced Iran to accept a cease-fire in August 1988. Khamenei said he expected the guards corps and the navy to perform their duties ``100 percent united.''", " The U.S. Army's heaviest ground firepower reached Saudi soil today for deployment behind Arab forces manning the front line in the monthlong standoff with Iraq. Dozens of M1-1P tanks and M2 Bradley armored infantry fighting vehicles, and scores more heavy support vehicles, rolled off two huge transport ships at a port in northeastern Saudi Arabia and were readied for the trip north into the desert. The M1s are by the far the biggest ground weapon in the burgeoning U.S. arsenal in Saudi Arabia, weighing an imposing 60 tons and carrying a 105 mm cannon said to be accurate at 6,600 feet or more. The huge but speedy tanks _ which can travel about 45 mph _ left the 24th Infantry (Mechanized) Division's home in Georgia two weeks ago. The 24th's heavy firepower will be deployed in front of most other U.S ground forces in Saudi Arabia but still a good distance behind the Saudi-led Arab forces, which are just miles from the border with occupied Kuwait. The U.S. buildup _ which could reach 200,000-250,000 ground forces _ is not expected to be completed until October. Transport planes are arriving around the clock, but the M1s and the 24th's other heavy weaponry have been long awaited by U.S. military commanders. Until now, the U.S.-led multinational Saudi defense force has been short on heavy ground firepower. ``This is boss,'' Sgt. Ronald Ruff said as he showed off his M1 to a group of reporters. ``This is the Cadillac model. This is the top of the line.'' Up to now, the only U.S. tanks in Saudi Arabia have been Vietnam era M60s, brought by the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, and even smaller M551 Sheridans. Iraq has a formidable force of Soviet-made tanks, primarily the export versions of its T64 and T72 models. The T64 is comparable in armament and armor to the M1s that arrived today; the T72 is equivalent to the more modern M1, the M1-A1. The U.S. tanks are considered to have superior weapons sighting and guidance systems, and the strategy for any tank war with Iraq is to use the air superiority of the American, Saudi and British forces to inflict heavy early damage on Iraqi tanks. ``There's no doubt in my mind that we'll succeed here if we have to,'' said Lt. Col. Barry Willey. ``Bring them (the Iraqis) on,'' Ruff said. ``We've the training and technology; they've got the numbers. We'll take them out.'' Several M1 crews said they will have to clean and change the M1's filters more often because of the talcum-like sand of the Saudi desert.", " The active-duty strength of the nation's military services declined in February from both the previous month and the year-earlier period, the Pentagon said Thursday. As of Feb. 29, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force had 2,163,193 men and women on active duty, down 2,625 from Jan. 31 and a decrease of 8,914 from the Feb. 28, 1987, tally. It is not unusual for military strength to swing up and down on a monthly basis during the year, primarily because of differences in the flow of new recruits. The strength totals are expected to vary even more widely than normal this year, though, because the Pentagon is reducing its active-duty strength in a budget-cutting move. According to the latest ``Military Strength'' assessment, three of the four armed services reported personnel reductions in February. The Marine Corps reported 198,231 men and women on active duty, down just 12 from January. The Air Force had 603,599 on active duty, down 975; and the Army listed 776,415, down 2,308. The Navy, meantime, reported an increase of 670 personnel in February, with 584,948 on active duty at the end of the month. The Marine Corps and Air Force reported declines in strength compared with Feb. 28, 1987, while the Navy and Army reported slightly increases.", " Today is Sunday, Oct. 9, the 283rd day of 1988. There are 83 days left in the year.", " Iraq said today it had moved Western detainees to vital military targets, making good on its threat to use them as human shields against a potential American attack. The message came after Iraq warned its own people not to hide foreigners or they would face the ``severest punishment.'' Iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as shields, and today's statement by the official Iraqi News Agency said some had already been scattered at the target sites. The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a spokesman for the Iraqi National Council as saying: ``Iraq's foreign guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good physical condition.'' The three-line dispatch provided no further details, such as how many foreigners had been moved or to what installations. Earlier, President Bush demanded that Iraq release all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and for the first time he referred to them as hostages. ``There can be little doubt that whatever these innocent citizens are called, they are in fact hostages,'' he said in a speech to war veterans in Baltimore. Also today, two senior U.N. officials headed for Baghdad to urge Iraq to free foreigners held captive in Kuwait and Iraq. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein requested the envoys be sent. In his speech, Bush repeated U.S. demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He also likened Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler. An Iraqi official also referred to World War II today, reminding the United States that it had once interned members of its own ethnic Japanese population. ``In response to the official American and Western declarations regarding Iraq's hosting of foreigners ... We would like to recall that America, during World War II, held about 100,000 of its own citizens of Japanese origin in detention camps to avert a potential Japanese attack on its western coast,'' said the statement carried by the state-run Iraqi News Agency. It was attributed to the Speaker of the Iraqi National Council, or parliament, Sadi Mehdi Saleh. The United States, meanwhile, picked up another ally in its military thrust against Iraq with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's announcement today that U.S. C-130 cargo transports have begun operating from the United Arab Emirates. Cheney's statement in Abu Dhabi marked an important show of cooperation from a gulf nation with international efforts to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Also today, OPEC said there was not enough support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider Saudi Arabia's request to boost oil production. A brief statement said OPEC's president would meet with some other oil ministers before the end of the month. Saudi Arabia said Saturday it would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day. Iraq said today that diplomats who fail to close their missions in Kuwait by Friday will be treated as any other foreign citizen. But in London, the Foreign office said Britain will attempt to keep an embassy in Kuwait. Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and West Germany said they had no plans to close their missions in Kuwait. The Iraqi radio message, monitored in Nicosia, warned Iraqi citizens against secretly sheltering foreigners to protect them. ``Hosting a foreigner in an Iraqi's place of residence is considered a flagrant violation of the law, for which the severest punishments will be given,'' it said. It said the law applied ``with (Iraq's) entire administrative border'' _ apparently including annexed Kuwait. On Sunday, Saddam offered to free foreigners if the United States withdraws its forces from the Persian Gulf region and guarantees the economic embargo will be lifted. U.S. officials dismissed the offer. He later said he would free citizens of nations that remain neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. There was growing international anxiety over the fate of the remaining foreign captives, including 3,000 Americans and 4,000 Britons, held for almost three weeks. Saddam said Sunday Westerners will be held at vital Iraqi installations to deter U.S. attacks on the facilities. ``Our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe,'' Saddam said, in comments read on Iraqi television. ``The presence of the foreigners with Iraqi families at vital targets might prevent an attack.'' Iraqi authorities also ordered Westerners in Kuwait to assemble at hotels or face the consequences. In other developments: _The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing'' two Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S. vessels on Saturday. _U.S. warships off the United Arab Emirates were challenging by radio practically every commercial ship coursing up and down the Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported today. _Iraq said today that Indonesian and some Argentine citizens may leave. _China's official Xinhua News Agency said the first group of 97 Chinese would be evacuated from Iraq today, with Baghdad's help. Also today, 122 Soviet citizens crossed into Jordan, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. _The British Foreign Office said today that 82 Britons were taken Sunday by Iraqi authorities from a hotel in Kuwait city. A day earlier, 41 British citizens were taken from the Kuwait International hotel. _Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal arrived in Damascus, Syria today to discuss the Gulf crisis with the Syrian leadership. _Two Dutch Navy frigates were leaving today for the Persian Gulf to join the multinational force arrayed against Iraq. The air defense frigate Witte de With and the standard frigate Pieter Florisz were to take two weeks to reach the region. _ Greece also said it would send a frigate. _Iraqi soldiers today continued their withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing up thousands of battle-hardened troops to face U.S. forces. Iraq and Iran were also repatriating prisoners from their eight-year war, which effectively ended with a cease-fire in August of 1988. _Iranian newspapers today attacked the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. The Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial the United States had virtually annexed Saudi Arabia, just as Iraq did Kuwait. But the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S. military presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. United Arab Emirates, an alliance comprising seven sheikdoms, today became the first of the moderate Arab governments in the southern gulf region to publicly announce overt military cooperation with the United States. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it would allow the deployment of Arab and ``friendly'' forces on its territory as part of multinational efforts to defend the Persian Gulf region. On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded that Iraq let all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait leave. CBS News said from Baghdad that 35 Americans, including four women and three children, took refuge at U.S. diplomatic ``quarters'' in the Iraqi capital Sunday. Asked about the report, a spokesman at the State Department said: ``We can't make a comment on that at this time.''", " Five U.S. diplomats from Kuwait today abandoned their besieged embassy and flew to Baghdad to join a last batch of Americans leaving Iraq and the occupied emirate aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi jet. Officials said the diplomats and 25 other Americans aboard the Boeing 707 that landed in Baghdad would be among 94 foreigners leaving in the afternoon on an Iraqi Airways flight to Frankfurt, Germany, in what was said to be the last charter plane carrying out foreign nationals. U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, Barbara Bodine, the deputy chief of mission in Kuwait, and three other American diplomats from Kuwait were whisked through the departure lounge and made no comment in Baghdad. ``They are in good spirits and good shape and ready to get back to the States,'' and American embassy official said on condition of anonymity. But while Iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage release announced one week ago, it remained at odds with Washington over when Secretary of State James A. Baker III can visit Baghdad for talks on preventing war. On Wednesday, the Bush administration accused President Saddam Hussein of blocking any agreement. The administration says Iraq's insistence on a Jan. 12 date for the visit is too close to the Jan. 15 deadline a U.N. resolution has set for Iraq to relinquish Kuwait or face possible attack. There is no disagreement over Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, meeting with President Bush in Washington on Monday, but the United States says it will not receive him unless a date has been set for Baker's visit. The Bush administration has suggested any time between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3. Also today, Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid left Baghdad for Iran after beginning a new Arab peace mission the day before during talks with Saddam. Among those waiting at the Baghdad airport for today's flight to Frankfurt were three families who missed a Tuesday flight because the Kuwaiti wives of Americans had to obtain Iraqi passports, officials said. The embassy had no estimate on the number of Americans or other passengers who would fly out of the country today on the Frankfurt-bound charter. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington on Wednesday that 15 Americans would be aboard the flight. Officials in Baghdad said that all others who wished to leave Kuwait and Iraq would do so by regular flights or by ground transportation. In other last-stage charter flights, 78 Japanese arrived in Tokyo Wednesday and 313 mostly British passengers landed in London on a chartered Iraqi Airways jet from Baghdad. Iraq had barred thousands of foreigners from travel after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It held hundreds of them - mostly Americans, Britons and Japanese - at strategic sites to deter a feared attack by U.S.-led forces sent to the region in response to the invasion. About 188 Americans have been evacuated from Iraq and Kuwait over the last week. They include 70 people who were in hiding, 86 men kept as ``human shields'' and 32 private citizens who had found refuge in U.S. compounds. U.S. officials estimate that about 500 Americans - most of them children with dual citizenship - are remaining. Howell and his colleagues at the U.S. embassy in Kuwait defied Iraqi orders to close in August. Gradually, all but the British and Americans removed their diplomats as Iraq cut off utilities and posted soldiers outside the compounds. Britain has joined the United States in deciding to remove its remaining diplomats now that the last of both countries' citizens are leaving Kuwait. Britain says its embassy staff will leave in the next week. On Nov. 30, a day after the U.N. Security Council passed the use-of-force resolution, Bush proposed the diplomatic exchange as a last-ditch effort to avoid war. Iraq accepted the idea, but Boucher complained Wednesday that Baghdad ``continued to block agreement on dates.'' Said the State Department spokesman: `We have offered 15 dates and Iraq has offered none.'' He said Baker is ``willing to go to Baghdad for a meeting on any one of the 15 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3 because we think these meetings are important and because we are serious about them.''", " The commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East said today there will be no war unless Iraq starts one, a move he said would be ``an awfully stupid mistake.'' Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, in his first news conference since moving his command post to Saudi Arabia, repeatedly ducked questions about specific U.S. military options under consideration. But he said the United States was not looking to start hostilities. ``There's not going to be any war unless the Iraqis attack,'' Schwarzkopf told reporters after spending the day visiting American troops in northeast Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf called the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ``not only a mugging but a rape.'' He said said Iraqi forces in Iraq and Kuwait appeared to be in defensive posture but were capable of taking the offense. ``They certainly have the capability to attack, although I think if they were to do so it would be an awful stupid mistake,'' Schwarzkopf said. The general glanced at the floor before answering a question about how much impact Iraq's holding of American and other Western hostages had on his military planning. ``I would tell you that obviously I am just as concerned as anyone else about every single human life,'' Schwarzkopf said. But, he added: ``What I have to do is plan the military component and not concern myself with the hostages.'' He refused to answer a question about whether his early declaration about war prospects meant that the United States would not make an offensive push to drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait. He also refused to say whether the military was aiding the Kuwaiti resistance. There have been reports that Army special operations forces are helping the resistance movement. There has been speculation that the United States would seek a permanent military foothold in Saudi Arabia regardless of the outcome of the current staandoff _ a delicate subject because of anti-American sentiment in parts of the Arab world. When asked about such prospects, Schwarzkopf said: ``We have no intention of establishing a permanent base in Saudi Arabia.'' Schwarzkopf laughed when asked who was in charge of the multinational forces. ``This is not NATO,'' he said. ``This is not a single command and there doesn't need to be.'' The United States has by far the biggest military presence in Saudi Arabia and many nations that have committed forces to the region have not yet sent them, or sent only small contingents. Asked by a French reporter if France should send more forces, Scwarzkopf said only: ``I would like all the help I can get.'' Schwarzkopf is a bear of a man and can be gruff at times. But he was grandfatherly during stops at several U.S. staging areas, filling the troops in on the latest developments in the crisis and promising them more newspapers and radios. After a briefing by commanders of the 101st Airborne Division's air assault brigade, Schwarzkopf walked into a garage area and immediately encountered Staff Sgt. John Frady, of Sylva, N.C., a member of a maintenance platoon who was in the process of receiving a haircut. The general asked him: ``Ready to do the job?'' Frady answered: ``Ready to go to war, sir.'' He next visited the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing from Myrtle Beach, S.C., telling them the arrival of the wing's A-10 tank-killers had made him more confident of the deterrent power of the U.S. deployment. He said the United States was there to defend Saudi Arabia but ready to fight back if Saddam Hussein ordered Iraqi forces to invade the kingdom. ``Let's face it, if he dares come across that border and comes down here, I'm completely confident that we're going to kick his butt when he gets here,'' Schwarzkopf said. Speaking to a group of officers in an air-conditioned tent at the same airstrip, Schwarzkopf said. ``Every now and then people have to go to war and ask themselves whether they are on the right side or the wrong side. There is no doubt that we are on the right side now, because the whole world is telling us that.'' His next and last stop was a Marine support camp in northeast Saudi Arabia, where Schwarzkopf received yet another briefing and visited with Marines digging a sandbag-lined foxhole. ``Our attitude has to be to be in this for the long haul,'' Schwarzkopf told a small group of Marines who had asked him about the latest developments in the crisis. One Marine said he had heard a rumor about the C-5 crash in Germany this week. Schwarzkopf told the group the transport indeed had crashed, killing 13 people. As the Marines shook their heads, Schwarzkopf said: ``That's 13 more counts against Saddam Hussein.''", " Iraq today accused Iran of shelling Iraqi military positions near the Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the Persian Gulf war broke out nearly eight years ago. The attacks, if confirmed, would be the first serious fighting reported since both nations agreed Monday at the United Nations to begin a cease-fire Aug. 20 and to open direct talks in Geneva five days later. The accusation came in a brief statement from the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations. It said the attacks occurred Wednesday and today. The statement said ``the Iranian armed forces bombarded Iraqi military positions'' around Basra and the Faw peninsula with howitzers, mortars and small missiles. The brief report to the United Nations did not denounce Iran. The statement also did not say whether Iraq suffered casualties. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who had no immediate comment on the statement, scheduled a meeting with Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani at the ambassador's request, presumably to discuss the situation. When Perez de Cuellar announced the cease-fire date, Iran gave him a letter pledging it would not launch any attacks prior Aug. 20. Iraq did not submit a similar letter, but the U.N. chief said Tuesday he had received oral assurances from both nations they would exercise restraint. The main attack on Basra involved 214 howitzer shells, 205 mortar rounds and 32 small missiles, the Iraqi statement said. The Faw bombardment involved 26 howitzer shells, 32 mortar rounds and 16 small missiles, it added. Both targets are near Shatt al-Arab, the disputed waterway that forms the southern border between Iran and Iraq. It is the only sea outlet Iraq has and it has been blocked by Iran since early in the war. Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 after border skirmishes in a bid to gain complete control of the waterway. Today's Iraqi statement also said without elaborating that an Iranian tank fired two missiles at Iraqi positions in the ``northern sector'' of the border. On Wednesday, Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, complained to Parez de Cuellar that Iraqi warplanes had buzzed Iranian cities and warned that more such flights could jeopardize the proposed truce. In Tehran on Wednesday, Iran's acting commander-in-chief, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said a U.N. inquiry must condemn Iraq as the aggressor in the war or the region will face grave consequences. After meeting with the U.N. chief, Mahallati told reporters that Iraqi overflights ``can be a dangerous opening. If it (the overflights) would be continued, I am afraid that it is an obstacle in the way of the secretary-general carrying out his task.'' Perez de Cuellar said of the alleged overflights: ``I am persuaded that if something happened, it was kind of a mistake, a technical mistake, a misunderstanding.''", " Schroeder.

The 29-year-old woman died Sept. 5 of pneumonia following a 26-pound weight loss, chronic tonsillitis and bronchitis and a serious decline in the count of her immune system's T-cells, the labor newspaper Trud reported. All are common symptoms of aquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the newspaper noted that epidemiologists were incensed that the woman's doctors failed to diagnose AIDS before she died. They are now trying to locate the victim's sexual partners to determine who else might be infected with the disease, and authorities are considering publishing the woman's photograph to alert her partners, Trud said. She was registered as a night school student and as a worker at a factory, but police said she earned her living as a prostitute for foreigners. Soviet officials say they have identified 83 AIDS carriers but only one person who has developed the deadly disease. However, they say other cases may have been diagnosed incorrectly. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.", " Mice prone to developing a blood cell cancer gained partial protection from a human gene that influences blood cell development, suggesting that developmental genes may affect vulnerability to cancer, researchers say. Such genes may make a difference in how long normal cells remain susceptible to turning malignant, they said. The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature by Philip Leder, Michel Nussenzweig and Emmett Schmidt of Harvard Medical School with colleagues there and at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. They worked with mice that carried a human c-myc gene, which puts them at high risk for developing a blood cell cancer called pre-B cell lymphoma. Pre-B cells are those that will develop as B cells, an important part of the body's disease-fighting immune system. Those mice were bred with others that carried a different human gene, one that makes B cells skip an early stage in their development. Some progeny from these matings inherited both human genes, and their lymphoma rates were compared to those that carried only the cancer-causing gene. Results showed that the gene that speeds development caused both a delay and a reduction in the tumors, researchers said. By 117 days of age, half the mice that carried only the cancer-causing gene had developed lymphoma, but none of the mice with both genes had developed it. After a year, more than 90 percent of the first group had developed tumors, compared to only 40 percent of the mice with both human genes. The developmental gene apparently hampered development of cancer by speeding up the maturation of pre-B cells, leaving fewer at stages most susceptible to the cancer-causing gene, researchers suggested. In general, a diverse group of genes that produce either an acceleration or pause in cell development may influence the rates and time of onset for cancer, researchers said.", " The number of white blood cells infected by the AIDS virus rises sharply in the year before virus-infected males actually develop the disease, says a study that may lead to speedier treatment for AIDS victims. While the existing test to detect the increase in AIDS-infected cells is too time-consuming and expensive for routine use, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is trying to develop a simpler test that could predict when an infected person will get full-blown AIDS, said the CDC's Janet Nicholson. Such a test would help doctors decide when the benefits of giving patients certain toxic anti-AIDS drugs outweigh the risks, said Dr. Paul Volberding, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and AIDS program director at San Francisco General Hospital. ``If we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of developing AIDS, we would want to treat the person at that point, even if he hadn't developed full-blown AIDS,'' he said. Nicholson, the CDC's clinical immunology chief, presented her findings Monday during the annual meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. She and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing blood cells from 15 homosexual Atlanta men who were infected by the virus and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didn't suffer AIDS. Six of the 15 subsequently developed AIDS, Nicholson said. She said in the year before those symptoms became apparent, the six showed a 25-fold increase in the number of AIDS virus-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells _ a class of white blood cells. If a simple test could show that someone infected with the virus soon will get AIDS, doctors could better decide when to prescribe AZT and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections that kill AIDS patients once the virus has crippled their immune systems, Volberding said. AZT, or azidothymidine, is believed to slow progression of AIDS. From a scientific standpoint, ``learning what a person's risk of developing AIDS is over time is a very important one,'' he said. But Nicholson and Volberding acknowledged that some AIDS-infected people may not want to learn that they soon will develop disease symptoms. Nicholson said researchers previously knew that people infected with AIDS show reduced numbers of one type of disease-fighting white blood cell, called T4-helper cells, while the infection progresses. Her study found that the number of helper cells decreases more quickly and the number of AIDS-infected cells rises sharply in infected patients who go on to develop overt AIDS symptoms. ``It's not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will develop disease,'' she said, adding that her findings point the way toward determining which patients are likely to do so. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and cancer. The CDC estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus, and of that total, 20 percent to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of 1991.", " The Centers for Disease Control disputes a study by the Hudson Institute that the number of Americans infected with the deadly AIDS virus is actually twice the official estimate. In a study released Friday, the Hudson Institute said that up to 3 million Americans are infected by the AIDS virus, an estimate that is far above the calculation by CDC, the primary federal agency monitoring the spread of AIDS. Kevin R. Hopkins, a Hudson mathematician, said his study uses ``realistic'' assumptions not used by the CDC and, as a result, his estimate is closer to the true number of Americans infected by the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS. ``The actual number of people carrying the HIV virus in the United States (at the end of 1987) was not the 900,000 to 1.4 million the official sources estimate, but probably more than twice that number,'' the Hudson report said. ``There were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the AIDS virus, with the most likely total of infections probably close to 2.4 million,'' the report said. Dr. Timothy Dondero, chief of a CDC branch studying the spread of AIDS, quickly disputed the claim, however. In a telephone interview from the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Dondero said he and his staff reviewed the Hudson study and the methods used and said, ``We do not feel a change in our data is appropriate.'' He said that for the Hudson model to be correct, about 2 percent of the young adult population in the United States would have to be infected with HIV. Yet, he said, ``their figures are inconsistently high within segments of populations for which there are test results.'' Dondero said tests from hospital patients, military recruits and prisoners show HIV infection rates of less than 1 percent _ 0.2 percent to 0.66 percent _ among young adults. Hopkins admitted, ``We're all in a guessing game'' when it comes to estimating the number of people infected with the AIDS virus. Nonetheless, he said he believed the Hudson method is a more realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation. ``The CDC may be right and we may be wrong,'' Hopkins said. ``Until a national seroprevalence test is conducted, we will not know. ... The main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about this disease.'' The study by Hudson, a privately financed public policy research organization with headquarters in Indianapolis, used basic CDC data on the number of AIDS cases. But Hopkins said Hudson used different computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques to estimate the rate of HIV infections. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is caused by the HIV virus, is the end stage of the disease and may not develop for years after a person is infected with the virus. But an infected person can spread the virus before developing AIDS. For this reason, experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic. HIV infection is determined by a blood test which identifies antibodies in blood serum. A person with such antibodies is known as seropositive. Hopkins said the Hudson study also estimated that the number of heterosexuals infected by the virus may be three times higher than CDC estimates. The CDC says the chief victims of AIDS, a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. The Hudson study estimates that of the 850,000 to 1.4 million heterosexuals infected with the HIV virus, between 200,000 and 500,000 are those who do not use drugs. ``There are vastly more heterosexuals infected today,'' said Hopkins. ``A breakout into the non-monogamous population is unavoidable.'' The CDC has estimated that the AIDS virus has infected only 80,000 to 165,000 of the non-drug-using heterosexual population. The Hudson report said about 118,000 of the heterosexuals infected are ``mainstream'' population members. ``They are not poor, and they are not IV drug users,'' Hudson said. ``But they are nonetheless carriers of the virus and, through their sexual contacts, can proceed to spread the disease to others of their same class.'' The CDC says that as of Aug. 15, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,702 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,898, have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.", " All children with severe measles should take vitamin A supplements to sharply reduce the risk of complications and death, a study published today concludes. Measles kills about 2 million children worldwide each year and leaves many more blind or afflicted with lung disease. The research conducted in South Africa found that the vitamin reduced the death rate by more than half and the duration of pneumonia, diarrhea and hospitalization by about one-third. The results ``indicate a remarkable protective effect of vitamin A in severe measles,'' the doctors wrote. Earlier research has turned up circumstantial evidence that the vitamin helps. As a result, the World Health Organization three years ago recommended that young measles victims take vitamin supplements anywhere that vitamin A deficiency is common or that more than 1 percent of measles cases are fatal. The study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine was conducted by Drs. Gregory D. Hussey and Max Klein of the University of Cape Town. The study randomly assigned 120 milligrams of vitamin A or identical-looking placeboes to 189 children who were hospitalized because of measles complicated by pneumonia, diarrhea or croup. Of the 12 children who died, 10 were taking placeboes. ``All children with severe measles should be given vitamin A supplements, whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional deficiency,'' the doctors wrote.", " Loma Linda Medical Center said Friday has accepted a fourth baby born with most of his brain missing and will keep it alive for up to a week in hopes that its organs can be used for transplant. The boy, identified only as Baby D, was born at an unidentified Southern California hospital Thursday and transferred to Loma Linda University Medical Center, said Anita Rockwell, a spokeswoman for the center. Baby D suffers from anencephaly, in which most of the brain is missing. The condition almost always leads to death within days or weeks. ``His parents want to donate their baby's organs when brain death occurs,'' Rockwell said. Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda chief of neonatology, said Baby D was resting comfortably Friday and receiving nutrition and water as needed. Rockwell said the newborn will be cared for for a seven-day period that began Thursday night. Under Loma Linda policy, Baby D will be placed on life support if needed to prevent damage to organs. If Baby D is declared brain-dead within seven days, the hospital will give notice that his organs are available for transplant. If he isn't brain dead within seven days, he will be allowed to die. The time limit was developed to alleviate ethical concerns that doomed anencephalics not be kept alive indefinitely merely so their organs can be donated. Rockwell said anonymity was requested by Baby D's parents and officials of the hospital where he was born. Baby D is the fourth anencephalic newborn accepted as a possible organ donor at the hospital. The first was stillborn Dec. 23, thwarting her parents' desire to have her major organs donated. Her corneas and heart valves were given to infants needing them. The second anencephalic was declared brain-dead Feb. 18. Attempts to donate his liver failed because potential recipients either weren't suitable matches or couldn't be operated on in time. He was disconnected from life-support Feb. 20. Most recently, a girl was transferred to Loma Linda after birth Feb. 20. Because she never met brain-death criteria within the seven-day limit, she was disconnected from a respirator and allowed to die on Feb. 28. However, her eyes, corneas and heart valves were later donated to infants needing organs. Loma Linda gained worldwide attention in 1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey, frustrated at the lack of heart donors for babies, transplanted a baboon's heart into a girl known as Baby Fae. She died 20{ days later. Bailey, whose baboon transplant was sharply criticized by many doctors, subsequently urged the use of anencephalics as donors of hearts and other organs.", " The Red Cross acknowledged Saturday it erred in distributing 24 pints of blood that had failed AIDS procedures but said none of the blood was used and none carried the deadly virus. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that the questionable one-pint units were shipped last month to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in Washington and Nashville, Tenn., but were never used on any patients. The FDA did not identify the facilities that received the blood. ``While it should not have been shipped, it actually proved to be HIV (AIDS virus) free, and a number of units underwent processing that would inactivate the virus,'' said Gene Jeffers, American Red Cross spokesman. He said there was ``no known health hazard associated with the 24 units of blood. We were very fortunate and lucked out in that there was no human risk at all involved here.'' Jeffers acknowledged, however, that five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens and could have posed a health risk had they been used in transfusions. However, they were not used, he said. Initial tests showed 10 of the questionable units contained HIV antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units underwent a process that breaks down the blood into components for specific uses and eliminates the virus, Jeffers said. The remaining nine units, he said, were from donors who were unacceptable because they previously tested ``false positive'' for AIDS, but all the actual units were tested as safe, he said. Federal officials estimate that the chances of getting AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, from a transfusion are one in 40,000. The chief victims have been homosexual men or intravenous drug users. No one is known to have recovered from the disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The Nashville Banner reported Saturday that two additional pints from disqualified donors were actually used in transfusions, but no patient was harmed. The newspaper gave no details of the transfusions but said follow-up tests of the blood donors showed they did not carry the AIDS virus. Jeffers said he knew of no actual transfusion of blood that should have been rejected. The FDA report said none of the questionable blood was used on patients. As a result of the errors, the FDA said it has increased its periodic audits of the blood supply and instituted new training procedures for blood bank employees. The mistake in Washington was discovered in a routine audit. The Tennessee errors came to light in an FDA investigation that followed a lawsuit against local blood bank officials by a woman who said she became infected with AIDS through a blood transfusion. Two senior officials of the Washington regional office of the American Red Cross _ John McGraw and Frederick Darr _ have been suspended with pay for 30 days pending an investigation of their actions, said Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross. Schubert said no officials in the Nashville center had been disciplined, but that the investigation there was continuing. Six of the questionable units of blood were from the Washington center and the other 18 were from Nashville, the FDA said.", " A panel of experts says removing a cancerous tumor in the early stages of breast cancer gives as good a survival chance to women as more radical surgery in which the entire breast is removed. Mastectomies, in which the entire breast is removed, and lumpectomies, in which only the tumor is removed, both give ``excellent'' results for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer, the panel said. The committee of 15 experts was assembled by the National Institutes of Health to consider research on the survival of women with early stages of breast cancer and to develop a consensus on what therapy should be used to treat the disease. ``The therapies appear to be equivalent in survival,'' said Dr. William C. Wood, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and chairman of the committee. ``We believe it is preferable to preserve an organ.'' Mastectomy is still the most commonly used therapy for early stage breast cancer, Wood said. A lumpectomy is followed with radiation therapy, and Wood said some patients choose mastectomy because they ``prefer to lose a breast instead of have six weeks of radiation therapy.'' In its report, the committee said surgery in which the breast is saved, or conserved, ``is an appropriate method of primary therapy for the majority of women with Stage I and II breast cancer, and is preferable'' because the breast is preserved and the survival chances are the same as for mastectomy. Wood said that both mastectomy and lumpectomy involves the removal of nearby lymph nodes. If these nodes are cancer-free and the primary tumor is smaller than one centimeter, both methods of treatment have about a 90 percent chance of cure. About 150,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, the committee report said. Between 75 percent and 80 percent of this group will have Stage I or Stage II disease, and about two-thirds of these will have cancer-free lymph nodes. Stage I and II cancers have not spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes. But just how to treat this early-stage breast cancer long has been controversial. Traditionally, the preferred treatment has been a radical mastectomy in which the entire breast and much adjacent tissue is removed. During the past two decades, there have been a number of studies comparing the survival results of less extensive breast surgery, including lumpectomy. The committee found that, based on the studies, survival rates are virtually the same for the two types of therapy. The experts said the picture was less clear for follow-up treatment using chemotherapy or a drug that blocks the hormone estrogen. The studies show a trend that may suggest an advantage in taking the follow up or adjuvant therapy, but the committee said the drugs may be toxic or degrade the patient's quality of life. For patients with very small primary tumors _ one centimeter or less _ adjuvant therapy is not required, the committee said. The committee also said that the use of lumpectomy should be based on an individual evaluation of each patient and with the full understanding by the patient of all the options. Lumpectomies are not appropriate for all Stage I or II patients because of the size of the breast, or the distribution of tumors or calcified lumps within the breast, the committee said.", " Disruptive children can cause parents to drink more, a Florida State University study released Friday shows. ``I'm not suggesting we blame children for the alcoholism of their parents, because those who grow up in alcoholic homes have suffered enough already,'' said Dr. Alan Lang, an associate professor of psychology at Florida State. ``Nonetheless, particularly difficult children can cause distress for parents and, in some cases, this may contribute to increased alcohol use.'' Contrary to the teachings of self-help groups, who place the onus on parents and tell children of alcoholics they aren't to blame, the Florida State study may provide the first documented evidence that children actually can cause their parents to drink more. Lang teamed with Dr. William Pelham of the University of Pittsburgh to conduct the research. ``Our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in parent-child interactions is a two-way street,'' Lang said. ``Problem drinkers make poor parents, but problem children may also drive parents to drink.'' He said the findings are similar to those of studies that show children who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral problems are abused more often than normal, obedient children. ``The point is that while we usually think of parents as influencers of children, children can affect parents as well,'' Lang said. ``And the outcome is not always favorable.'' Dr. Robin Room, scientific director of the Alchohol Research Group of the Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, wasn't surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into the cause of drinking among parents, ``rather than give in to the bumper sticker-type humor that says children cause their parents to drink. ``It's important to understand that parental drinking patterns can later influence their children's drinking patterns,'' Room said. The Florida researchers, under a grant from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked 120 parents with 5-to-12-year-old sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a similar age. The parents were then given an opportunity to drink as much or as little alcohol as they wanted, while anticipating a second interaction with the same child. Half of the parents in the study had difficult children of their own with short attention spans, hyperactivity, conduct disorders, or some combination of the three. The other half had only children without behavior disorders. But the researchers stacked the deck. Half the parents had initially interacted with boys who behaved normally, while half had faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive and disruptive way. Among parents of normal children, those who interacted with disruptive boys drank one-third more than those who interacted with a cooperative child. ``I feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the characteristics and behaviors of children,'' Lang said. Parents with disruptive children at home responded differently to the study, however, depending on the drinking patterns of their own parents. Those who had a family history of drinking problems drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant child-actor, while those with no such family history drank less. ``This suggests that people differ in their vulnerability to increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a difficult child,'' Lang said.", " Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in volatile early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. All the markets opened lower, but then soybeans moved sharply lower while wheat turned higher. ``It's a bloodbath here this morning'' in the soybean pit, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Soybeans for delivery in November fell 10 cents a bushel in the first half-hour of trading. ``The market opened weaker than expected, then sold off sharply,'' Lespinasse said. ``There's just a bearish mentality that started after the bulls were unable to rally the market.'' Some blamed the early soybean sell-off on disappointment over the slow pace of grain sales for export. The Soviet Union bought a large amount of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal last week, but the Agriculture Department has not confirmed rumors of further large Soviet purchases. In early trading, wheat was \\ cent to 1{ cents higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.16{ a bushel; corn was 1\\ cents to 2\\ cents lower with December at $2.75} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents lower to 2\\ cents higher with December at $2.14{ a bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to 11 cents lower with November at $7.82 a bushel.

Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday.", " Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn prices opened higher as rains continue to hamper planting and increases the likelihood of a reduced crop yield, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. However, traders began to liquidate their positions for the weekend, and futures were moving lower. Soybean futures were steady to slightly lower as soggy fields delay the planting of the soybean crop. But the potential for increased soybean acreage as farmers switch from corn is weighing on prices. Wheat futures were higher on reports that disease is spreading through the soft red winter wheat crop in the southern Midwest, Lespinasse said. In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.35\\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with July at $2.87 a bushel; oats were } cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $1.48{ a bushel; soybeans were a \\ cent to 2 cents lower with July at $6.02{ a bushel. Livestock futures were mostly higher and pork futures lower in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Cattle prices were higher on follow-through buying from Thursday's strong close and on active meat sales. Pork futures plunged on fund liquidation due to lower cash prices. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .28 cent higher with June at 75.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .20 cent higher with August at 85.30 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent to 1.02 cents lower with June at 63.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .55 cent lower to .03 cent higher with July at 66.85 cents a pound. Livestock and pork futures settled mixed in Thursday's trading.", " Futures prices for grains and soybeans were mostly higher at the close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. ``There was a pretty good rally in soy oil that gave soybeans a good boost,'' said Joel Karlin, analyst with Research Department Inc. ``India bought into the palm oil market. African countries have shown some interest in vegetable oils, too.'' Corn was supported by a rumor that the Soviet Union might be interested in as much as 1 million tons, he said. Export news sent wheat prices higher, said Susan Leighty, grains analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed rumors that China had bid for 300,000 tons of the U.S. commodity, and rumors persisted that the Chinese would bid for 300,000 tons more. The Soviet Union was also said to be in the market for 500,000 tons of export bonus wheat, she said. Also firming wheat prices were weather reports calling for mild conditions in the next few days that might make the winter crop more vulnerable to a cold snap later, Mrs. Leighty said. At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents higher, with the contract for March at $4.10} a bushel; corn was \\ cent lower to { cent higher, with March at $2.37} a bushel; oats were { cent to 2{ cent lower, with March at $1.50}, and soybeans were 2 cents to 6{ cents higher, with January at $5.67 a bushel.", " Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid slack export demand and forecasts for showers and cooler temperatures in the Corn Belt later this week. Corn futures prices fell nearly 10 cents a bushel, the permitted daily limit. The corn market was the leader in a session that featured relatively light trading and wide price swings in the soybean pit. Soybean futures, which are limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel, have recently provided direction to the grain markets. But soybeans lost traders Tuesday to the lower-risk corn pit, said Steve Freed, a grain analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Despite a record-melting heat wave that threatens further damage to the drought-stressed soybean crop, Freed said speculators shied away from the soybean market when prices for near-month delivery approached $9 a bushel Tuesday morning. Meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving into the Midwest on Thursday. The forecasts, plus a lack of substantial export business, left the markets with little bullish news. ``It's still a bullish market, but it's a market that has trouble finding itself on days like today,'' Freed said. At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3} cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $3.90{ a bushel; corn was 4} cents to 9} cents lower with September at $2.87{ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents to 9} cents lower with September at $2.78{ a bushel; soybeans were 21 cents lower to 20 cents higher with August at $8.66 a bushel.", " Indications that the Brazilian soybean crop may be larger than expected sent U.S. soybean futures prices down modestly Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain futures closed mixed to lower. Soybean futures opened lower on news that rain had eased dry conditions in the soybean-growing region of Brazil. Later in the morning, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric tons, significantly higher than the U.S. Agriculture Department's latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons. ``This estimate was obviously negative for the U.S. market, and it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. Grain and soybean futures also retreated in reaction to generally lower prices for other commodities, Spilka said. Losses in corn were limited by expectations of new Soviet purchases, he said. At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.18 a bushel; corn was unchanged to { cent lower with March at $1.98{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with March at $1.90} a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3\\ cents lower with March at $6.22 a bushel.", " Grain and soybean futures prices edged lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid fears that Moscow's reprisals against Lithuania could jeopardize U.S. grain sales to the Soviet Union. Reports that the Soviet Union had cut off oil shipments to the breakaway republic triggered speculation that the United States will back away from granting the Soviets most favored nation trade status. The designation would allow for freer trade between the superpowers. Forecasts for increasingly wet, warm weather in the Midwestern croplands prompted further selling this morning. Rain was expected in the region today and Friday, and the National Weather Service has predicted above-normal temperatures for the Midwest during the latter half of next week. Higher prices for soybean meal in Europe helped to limit losses in the soybean market. In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1{ cents lower with the contract for delivery in May at $3.63} a bushel; corn was { cent to 1 cent lower with May at $2.72} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.56{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to \\ cent higher with May at $5.94\\ a bushel. Cattle futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork futures advanced, led by a surge in pork-belly prices amid bullish chart signals.

Cattle futures were mixed on Wednesday while pork futures were mostly higher.", " Grain and soybean futures prices were sharply down Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, as a result of increased harvest pressures and declines on the precious metal and energy markets. Wheat futures prices fell to levels from two weeks ago amid doubts the Soviet Union does not plan to buy subsidized wheat flour from the government, along with professional selling by major companies and near-ideal harvest conditions, analysts said. ``There's a very weak export outlook to buy grains,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. in New York. ``You're moving grains into positions to be sold and you don't have any ready buyers, so that's going to push prices lower.'' Soybean futures pushed toward double-digit losses as major corporations sold off their interest. Near-ideal weather conditions in areas where the crop is grown also added pessimism the entire harvest would be sold, Spilka said. Corn followed soybeans and wheat amid the same fears. At the close, wheat futures were 7} cents to 3\\ cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $2.70a bushel ; corn was 5 cents to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.23 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents lower to { cent higher with December at $1.19{ a bushel; soybeans were 11} cents to 5 cents lower with November at $6.06\\ a bushel.", " Too much rain kept corn futures prices growing Friday and new forecasts called for no change in the soggy conditions that have stalled spring planting in the Midwest. Other grain and soybean futures also advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade. On other commodity markets, cocoa futures retreated; livestock and meat futures rose; precious metals were mixed; and oil futures were mixed. Corn futures settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher in Chicago with the contract for delivery in July at $2.84 a bushel. The July contract's gains totaled 9\\ cents in the three days ending Friday. Wheat futures settled { cent lower to 3 cents higher with July at $3.30 a bushel; oats were 1\\ cents to 2 cents higher with July at $1.54{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3} cents higher with July at $6.19 a bushel. Forecasts for scattered showers in the Corn Belt well into next week ``overwhelmed everything else'' in the corn market Friday, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's wet, it's been wet and it looks like it's going to continue to be wet,'' he said. After the close, the National Weather Service released a six-to-10-day forecast predicting wetter-than-normal conditions in the Midwest from May 31 through June 4. ``It looks like a real soggy run for the eastern Corn Belt,'' said Richard Feltes, director of commodity research with the futures brokerage Refco Inc. About 20 percent of the nation's corn crop remains to be planted, Lespinasse said. If farmers don't get the seed into the ground within the next 10 days, yield losses are likely, he said. That propect was reflected in steeper losses in the new-crop corn contracts than in the July contract, which represents the last of the old-crop corn. The pattern was reversed in the soybean market, reflecting the possibility that farmers will plant soybeans on acres they had planned to sow with corn. Cocoa futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, erasing Thursday's gains as traders took profits ahead of the long holiday weekend. Prices climbed to new 14-month highs on Thursday and surged again in early trading Friday on news of a customs workers strike in the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. Traders quickly discounted the importance of the strike, though, since most of the available Ivory Coast cocoa already has been shipped. Cocoa settled $25 to $30 lower with July at $1,464 per ton. Most livestock and meat futures rose moderately on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in pre-weekend position-evening after several days of weakness, especially in pork futures. After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly report that showed 102.2 million pounds of pork bellies in the nation's commercial freezers. The number was near market expectations. Live cattle futures settled .02 cent to .25 cent higher with June at 73.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August at 83.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .37 cent higher with June at 65.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to .38 cent higher with July at 65.85 cents a pound. Gold futures rose modestly on New York's Commodity Exchange on light volume, supported in part by slight weakness in the dollar. The advance extended the market's recovery from Wednesday's plunge of more than $11 an ounce. Gold futures settled $1.50 to $1.90 higher with June at $368.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents higher with May at $5.215 a troy ounce. Energy futures ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Near-term crude oil deliveries finished slightly lower after a burst of buying early in the session that analysts linked to bullish chart signals. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 12 cents higher with July at $17.80 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to .38 cent lower with June at 49.66 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .40 cent lower to .18 cent higher with June at 63.41 cents a gallon.", " Expectations of a buildup in petroleum supplies in the nation's storage tanks sent oil futures prices tumbling Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said investors sold energy contracts ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report, which was released after the close of trading. The report showed, as investors expected, increases in heating oil and gasoline stocks. Crude oil supplies declined. In trading on the New York Merc, the March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 17 cents to $21.60 per 42-gallon barrel. The April crude oil contract declined 13 cents to $21.02 and May lost 12 cents to $20.63. Among refined products, heating oil for February delivery fell 1.71 cents to 59.28 cents a gallon, March declined 0.93 cent to 57.07 cents and April ended 0.32 cent lower at 55.18 cents a gallon. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery dropped 1.02 cents to 59.62 cents a gallon, while March lost 0.74 cent to 60.58 cents and April slipped 0.43 cent to 61.51 cents a gallon. Analysts said imports and continued strong refinery output in the face of weakening demand contributed to the buildup in energy inventories. ``Looks like a lack of demand for heating oil because of the warmer weather,'' said Tom Bentz, director of futures trading for United Energy Inc. ``On crude, it's imports and refinery runs.'' According to the API, a trade association representing mainly large oil refiners, gasoline stocks rose 4.6 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 19 to 219.5 million barrels; heating oil stocks rose 3.4 million barrels to 111.8 million; and crude oil declined 1 million barrels to 344 million. Most of the decrease in crude oil was from one geographic area, while inventories in other regions rose, analysts said.", " Wheat futures prices dropped and cattle futures climbed Thursday as an intense winter storm system muscled into the Southern Plains, bringing badly needed moisture to the winter wheat crop and slowing livestock marketings. On other commodity markets Thursday, orange juice futures fell sharply; most energy futures rose; and precious metals retreated. Meteorologist Harvey Freese of Freese-Notis Weather Inc. in Des Moines, Iowa, said the winter storm was likely to bring the largest snowfall amounts in two years to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. Snow amounts of up to five inches were already reported in Texas on Thursday afternoon and the precipitation was expected to continue into Saturday, Freese said. Snow and rain was expected to spread over a wide area, including western Kansas and western Nebraska, before the system pushes north and east into the Midwest. The heavy downfall will help relieve the unusally dry conditions that have prevailed in winter wheat country since late autumn. ``This is the biggest rain event since September,'' said Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ``They are likely to get as much snow today, tonight and tomorrow as they usually get in January or February,'' Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 3\\ cents lower on the Chicago Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in March at $3.97} a bushel, its lowest close since Sept. 28. Corn futures finished { cent to 1} cents higher with March at $2.42 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $1.38\\ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 3{ cents higher with January at $5.60} a bushel. Expectations for a storm-related slowdown in cattle marketings helped to boost live cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where contracts for February and April delivery posted new life-of-contract highs. Live cattle settled .05 cent to .58 cent higher with February at 78.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with January at 83.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 49.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies finished 1.35 cents lower to .08 cent higher with February at 55.52 cents a pound. Orange juice futures plunged on the New York Cotton Exchange amid profit-taking by speculators who participated in the market's spectacular 60 percent runup following the Christmas freeze in Florida's citrus belt. ``It's about time we have a correction after a 75-cent move'' to $2 a pound, said analyst Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc. Frozen concentrated orange juice futures finished 1.7 cents to 5.5 cents lower with January at $1.907 a pound. Petroleum futures ended mixed in volatile trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as crude and heating oil bounced back from Wednesday's losses. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 66 cents higher with February at $22.76 a barrel; heating oil was .56 cent to 1.32 cents higher with February at 61.84 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .71 cent lower to .91 cent higher with February at 60.71 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures sank on selling that analysts attributed to abundant silver supplies and perceptions of an industrial slowdown, which would reduce demand for silver in industrial applications. Gold settled $1.80 to $2.50 lower with February at $411.20 a troy ounce; silver was 5.4 cents to 6.8 cents lower with March at $5.24 a troy ounce.", " An official said on Friday that a Chinese smuggler paid a U.S. immigration agent up to $1 million to allow more than 200 Chinese emigrants into the United States by way of the Virgin Islands. At a detention hearing, Magistrate Jeffrey Resnick ordered jailed without bail inspector Juanito Creque of the Immigration and Naturalization Service; Leonard Y. Hu, the alleged smuggler, and five illegal immigrants. Creque and Hu are charged with conspiracy to smuggle illegal aliens across a U.S. border. Hu is charged with bribery and Creque with accepting a payoff. U.S. Attorney Terry Halpern said in asking for their detention, ``They are international travelers with connections in many foreign points along the route used to bring Red Chinese from mainland China to St. Croix and St. Thomas.'' Customs agent Ramon Davila, who posed undercover as a co-conspirator during the investigation, said in an affidavit that the aliens traveled to the Virgin Islands by way of Hong Kong, London and the West Indies island of Antigua. Davila said Hu paid Creque $5,000 each _ or up to $1 million _ for more than 200 illegal Chinese immigrants Creque allowed to enter the Caribbean territory and continue on to the the mainland United States last year. Davila said Hu paid him $15,000 in bribes to allow five Chinese safe passage to the United States in November. He said in the affidavit that Hu and the five aliens were kept under surveillance and traced to a restaurant on Mott Street, in New York City's Chinatown district. Hu, Creque and six others were arrested this week at St. Thomas airport as the aliens were trying to travel to New York. The six others _ Antiguans Everton Coates and his wife Millentine, and Chinese Tong Xiang Yang, Zhou Tu Ni, Jufoi Wu and Dian Min Zheng _ were charged with conspiracy and entry without inspection. According to Davila's affidavit, Coates was the Antiguan contact and his wife coordinated the alien shipment and was in communication with Creque. Mrs. Coates was released on $35,000 property bond. All the other remained in jail. A trial date has not been set.", " Since the prison disturbances by Mariel Cuban detainees last fall, the government has released more than 1,000 of the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in communities, the Justice Department announced Friday. One of the triggers to last year's uprisings at federal prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., was the fact that the government was taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding halfway house space for the detainees. From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances. INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots. Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the denials have been decided since the uprisings. When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees in various facilities. The Justice Department also announced it plans to repatriate 14 Mariel Cubans, the first group of detainees designated for return to Cuba since the prison disturbances. The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for crimes committed in the United States, have been notified that the INS intends to send them back, the Justice Department said. Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by a Justice Department review panel under an agreement which ended the rioting at Atlanta and Oakdale. Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to submit additional information on their behalf to the Justice Department review panels, which specifically exclude immigration officers.", " The House on Tuesday killed a move to establish procedures to review the continued detention of Cubans who entered the United States during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Under legislation defeated by a 271-144 vote, Mariel aliens denied parole would have been given the right to a hearing before an administrative law judge. The hearing would have been required within 90 days after the end of a Justice Department review, or within 90 days of the alien's detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The legislation provided that to continue detention, the department would have to prove that the detainee would pose a threat to the community or would violate reasonable conditions of release. Aliens released under the legislation would only have been sent to a halfway house or to a suitable sponsor. Mariel Cubans not released under the procedures would have had annual reviews, to determine whether circumstances justified reopening hearings. More than 125,000 Cubans came to the United States between April and October 1980, when Cuba opened its port of Mariel for citizens wishing to leave. The group included many people with criminal records and mental illness. Last year, Cuban detainees rioted at the Oakdale correctional facility in Louisiana and the federal prison in Atlanta after the United States and Cuba agreed to resume a migration agreement. At the time, there were 2,500 Cubans waiting for repatriation. In the wake of the riots, a new Justice Department review program was started for detainees designated for repatriation, and those denied parole by the INS.", " At least 12 Mariel prisoners have apparently exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within days, but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any deportations, a newspaper reported Thursday. Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by the Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursday on the prisoners. Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan to ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their communist homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported. ``There is a chance if we all speak with one united voice here and explain the merits of our case,'' said Rafael Penalver, chairman of the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations. Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlanta prison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport.'' A special three-member Justice Department panel was created in the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel detainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past two months, the panel has looked at prison records, immigration history, written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers. Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed immigration pact between the United States and Cuba that allows up to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to emigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500 prisoners. The Justice Department contends that these prisoners are criminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from the port of Mariel. Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of Mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 immigration pact. Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National Foundation, acknowledges there is much division over the deporations, even in Dade County's Cuban exile community. He said the foundation favors letting Cubans apply for visas to immigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba. ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in Cuba and then support sending them back,'' Mas said.", " The Communist government for the first time has allowed the family of a high-level defector to go abroad to visit him and it is considering letting him return from China, an official said Saturday. The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the move was meant as a gesture of good will toward China before the visit of Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem to Beijing. It will be Liem's third round of talks in China on the Cambodian civil war and other barriers to normalizing ties between Vietnam and China. The Vietnamese government allowed the wife and daughter of 87-year-old defector Hoang Van Hoan _ a founding member of the Vietnamese Communist Party _ to travel to Beijing to visit him last month, the government official said. The decision was made by the Politburo, the highest body of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, he said. The official also said the Chinese government last month asked Vietnam to let Hoan return home. No decision has been made, the official said. But he added, ``People tend to think it's about time to take him back; even some high-ranking officials think so.'' Hoan, a member of the Politburo from 1957 to 1976, was the first top Vietnamese leader to defect to China. Hoan disappeared at Karachi airport in Pakistan in July 1979. A month later he surfaced in Beijing, he attacked the Vietnamese party leadership, saying it was guilty of using ``Stalinist'' methods and abandoning friendship with China for the Soviet Union. Hoan called for a revolution in Vietnam. The Vietnamese official who spoke Saturday said Hoan had also published a Vietnamese-language newsletter critical of Hanoi while he was in China. Vietnam and China were allies during the Vietnam War, but they had a falling-out in 1978 over border disputes, Vietnam's treatment of its ethnic Chinese population and growing Vietnamese-Soviet ties. China launched a brief border attack in early 1979, saying it wanted to ``punish'' Vietnam for invading Cambodia and toppling the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge government. China continues to arm the Khmer Rouge and two other guerrilla groups now fighting the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia. However, relations with China have improved during Liem's three visits to Beijing over the past 15 months. An assistant Chinese foreign minister, Xu Dunxin, is to arrive in Hanoi on June 9 to continue the talks on Cambodia and normalizing relations. Xu will be leading the first senior Chinese delegation to Vietnam since 1979.", " An attorney for 13 Cuban detainees argued Tuesday they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylum before being sent back to the homeland they fled in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Lee Ochoa of Miami, an attorney for 13 of 15 Cubans convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, told U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon that some of the Cubans were afraid to go home because they did not know how they would be treated by Fidel Castro's government. Clemon said he will rule Monday on whether to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to fly the 13 back to Cuba. Clemon said he wanted to give attorneys for the Cubans time to support their request for a preliminary order blocking the deportation. The INS on Nov. 17 notified 15 Cubans at at the Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega that they would be deported within 72 hours. However, the next day the government promised Clemon it would not send them home until their attorneys had a chance to study their files. Leo Ochoa of Miami, attorney for 13 of the 15, told Clemon that they have a constitutional right to petition for political asylym and to due process. ``In this country we want to do things fairly and properly,'' Ochoa said. But Lauri Fillppu of the INS said that the Cubans' only claim for asylum is that they might be harmed in Cuba. He said the 11th U.S. Circuit Court in Atlanta already had rejected that argument. Fillppu questioned what he called ``a last-minute tactic'' by the Cubans, claiming there was no new evidence.", " Customs agents detained a plane chartered by Air Panama to search for any U.S. currency being taken illegally out of the country Wednesday but found none and sent the aircraft on its way, a spokesman said. ``U.S. Customs had some information that there might possibly be an outbound currency violation connected with the flight,'' spokesman Michael Sheehan said. The chartered Boeing 707 was scheduled to carry military and police-type uniforms, small machinery and other merchandise to Panama City, Sheehan said. It was detained for four hours Panama's national currency is the U.S. dollar, and the cash supply has been drying up because of a dispute over control of the Panamanian government. Panama keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit in American banks, but U.S. judges froze assets in banks in Miami and New York to prevent the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from withdrawing funds.", " President Fidel Castro has enhanced his image on human rights by releasing hundreds of political prisoners, but dissidents say thousands more remain in jail or are ostracized for opposing the regime. Communist authorities have nearly halved the dissident population in Cuban prisons since Cardinal John O'Connor of New York asked Castro to release 433 people charged with political crimes, said Bienvenido Avierno, a Foreign Ministry official. O'Connor visited Cuba in April. Former political prisoners are among the 300 or so Cubans leaving Havana each month aboard charter flights that depart four times a week for Miami. Asked if the releases benefit the government by letting it purge dissidents, Avierno said, ``Sure, we are maintaining these guys.'' One dissident here says the government has only become more sophisticated in curbing its domestic opposition. ``Everything is repressive here,'' Ricardo Bofill, president of the banned Cuban Human Rights Committee, said in a recent interview at his one-room apartment in the Havana suburb of Guanabacoa. ``Their tactics have changed. Now they use mobs and press campaigns.'' Bofill, a Communist Party member before Castro came to power in 1959, has been jailed several times for speaking out against the government. He has stayed at home for the past four months, saying he fears for his life. ``There are death threats. I have been identified in Cuba as the head of the counterrevolutionaries, the No. 1 enemy,'' Bofill said, sitting in a rocking chair in his room. The Communist Party newspaper Granma devoted several pages in April to discrediting Bofill. ``He is totally twisted and imbued with double-dealing lies, faking, deception and, especially a monstrous ego and unquenchable thirst for fame and notoriety,'' it said. Bofill's group compiles and distributes reports of government abuses. He showed a reporter a handwritten prison pamphlet called ``Dawn,'' which detailed ``systematic cruelty.'' He said Cuba has 10,000 political prisoners. Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, put the number at 450 in its 1987 annual report. The Castro government tolerates Bofill, often citing his criticisms as proof Cuba has freedom of expression. Avierno flatly denies there are any rights abuses in Cuba: ``The people, for the first time in their lives, have the arms. If they didn't like the system they could use them.'' Bofill said he does not oppose the government, but rather its tactics: ``This is not a fight against the system, it is against an unjust order. The basic rights, the right to life, is not guaranteed.'' In Cuba, only state-run news media are allowed to operate and the government decides who can leave the country and who can return. Bofill displayed his identification card, a booklet resembling a passport, and showed the government stamp that indicates he has applied for permission to leave the country. He said the stamp identifies him and thousands of others as malcontents. Roberto Bermudez, 32, a painter, said his opposition to the government has meant he can't exhibit his paintings. Sebastian Arcos, a former professor of dentistry and ex-political prisoner, said thousands of Cubans depicted as social outcasts are unable to find work. Cuba's socialist policies mean free and often model health care and education. The government says its provision of these social services constitutes a human right. ``This is a country where we have education, health, a country where drugs, especially hard drugs, are unheard of. No child needs to leave his studies to help his family. Violence is practically unknown. These are human rights,'' Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the Council of State, said in an interview. Castro this year permitted the International Red Cross to examine Cuban prisons for the first time. A confidential report is being prepared. In addition, a United Nations human rights group is expected to inspect the prisons by September. The United States maintains no formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. But the U.S. Interests Section in Havana receives ``thousands upon thousands of letters from Cubans requesting political asylum in the United States,'' spokeman Jerry Scott said. An agreement renewed last year will allow 3,000 Cubans to travel to the United States as refugees. Avierno said the Cuban government agreed to free most of the prisoners requested by O'Connor ``if the United States guarantees they can go there.'' About 40 of that group will not be released because they ``are very dangerous people and they must fulfill their sentences,'' Avierno said. The maximum prison term is 30 years.", " Chinese authorities are arresting and torturing Tibetans despite the end of martial law in Tibet, the Dalai Lama said Wednesday. The Nobel prize winner and spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists was in New York to help launch a yearlong campaign to raise public awareness of Tibetan culture and call attention to China's rule over his homeland. In March 1989, civil strife rocked Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and martial law was imposed for a year. The Public Security Bureau in Tibet later said 387 Lhasa citizens died in the anti-Chinese riots. Most of them were Tibetans but some security forces also were killed, the bureau said. Tibetans claim more than 450 of their people were killed. Martial law was lifted in March, but the Dalai Lama told reporters ``the actual situation has not at all improved.'' ``The military uniformed personnel changed their clothes to police uniforms and plainclothes. ... Incidents of arrest and torture, these also continue,'' said the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership of his people. He said he feared that ``in 15 years, if present conditions don't change, the Tibetan community will become insignificant in its own land,'' now a province of China. About 6 million Tibetans still live in their homeland, but they are outnumbered by Chinese even in Tibet. ``After 40 years of Chinese occupation, much of Tibet's civilization has been destroyed,'' the Dalai Lama said. Actor Richard Gere, who is the president of Tibet House in New York, introduced the Dalai Lama at a news conference to begin the Year of Tibet, a series of art exhibits and cultural events to promote public awareness of Tibetan culture. ``Many of my friends find Tibetan culture quite healthy, quite useful,'' said the Dalai Lama, who then chuckled and added, ``But I don't know.'' Many of his remarks were sprinkled with self-deprecating humor. The Year of Tibet opens with a show of more than 150 works of Tibetan art, including 31 from the Hermitage collection in Leningrad, in April 1991 at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. It moves to New York in October 1991.", " The former director of immigration under Manuel Antonio Noriega, charged with selling passports and visas, left the Vatican Embassy on Wednesday and gave up to U.S. troops, an embassy official said. Former director Belgica de Castillo and her husband, Carlos Castillo, left the nunciature of their own accord, said the Rev. Joseph Spiteri. Still inside is Capt. Eliezer Gaytan, chief of Noriega's personal security force. The Castillos sought refuge shortly after U.S. troops invaded on Dec. 20. Deposed dictator Noriega himself holed up in the embassy from Dec. 24 to Jan. 3 before turning himself over to U.S. soldiers. Spiteri said a U.S. military vehicle picked up the Castillos and took them to a U.S. base. Panama's new government said Monday that eight former immigration officials, including Mrs. Castillo, were being charged with corruption for selling visas and passports. Attorney General Rogelio Cruz announced Wednesday that a private law firm had filed a complaint against Manuel Solis Palma, who served as acting president for six months in 1988, but was never recognized by the United States, which considered him a Noriega puppet. The complaint accusing Solis Palma of ``usurping public functions and committing crimes against political liberties'' was being investigated, Cruz said. He said Solis Palma, now a private citizen in Panama, asked for a guarantee he would not be arrested if he agreed to meet with authorities for questioning. Solis Palma replaced President Eric Arturo Delvalle after Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 and was acting president until Sept. 1, 1988. New U.S. Ambassador Deane R. Hinton presented his credentials to President Guillermo Endara on Wednesday and said U.S.-Panamanian relations were ``perfect'' following Noriega's ouster. ``I see no problems now,'' Hinton said, speaking to reporters in Spanish after meeting Endara. ``We will support and work with the democratic government of Panama.'' John Grant McDonald, the new British ambassador, also presented his credentials but made no statement. Panamanians continued to pick over the remains of the building in downtown Panama City where Noriega had his military headquarters, toting away everything from furniture to track lighting and pornography. The building, heavily damaged by fighting in the invasion, will be demolished on Thursday, Housing Minister Raul Figueroa said. Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panamanians linked to Noriega have taken refuge in the embassies of Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba and the Vatican. All but the Bolivian mission are surrounded by U.S. troops. Cruz said two of the 12 Panamanians who sought refuge in the Peruvian Embassy were suspects in the killing of Maj. Moises Giroldi, who led an unsuccessful coup attempt against Noriega on Oct. 3. He did not identify the two but said the Foreign Ministry would tell Peru ``they are not being persecuted politically'' and so could not be given asylum. Noriega's family is in the Cuban Embassy. Linares said Panama is considering their request for safe-conduct to the Dominican Republic but must first decide whether they can be charged with any offenses.", " Scientists injected 2,200 corn stalks with a microbe effective against the destructive European corn borer Thursday in the first approved outdoor test of a genetically engineered ``plant vaccine.'' Environmental groups did not oppose the tests, which were approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture. The tests of the Cxc-Bt at the federal experimental station here are the first approved of a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,'' said Peter Carlson, chief scientist of Crop Genetics International, which developed the biological pesticide. Cxc-Bt was also injected into an acre of corn owned by Crop Genetics on Maryland's Eastern Shore, a company spokesman said. Only one other genetically engineered crop protector, Frostban, a frost-inhibiting microbe, has been approved for field testing by the EPA. ``I think the result could be reduced use of chemicals for crop protection,'' Carlson said. He said that would be ``good for farming, good for the environment and good for the food supply.'' The corn borer, a moth larva introduced to the United States in 1908, is one of agriculture's most destructive pests, attacking about 200 plant species, Crop Genetics said. It costs American farmers $400 million a year, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The Audubon Society and Environmental Defense Fund took a wait-and-see attitude. The important question is whether testing and regulation will be adequate because Cxc-Bt is just the beginning of a rush of perhaps hundreds of similiar products, said Maureen Hinkle, the society's director of agriculture policy. Carlson said the main purpose of the test is to determine whether the pesticide will spread from plant to plant, an undesireable effect. The microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of corn borers, giving them ulcers. It doesn't affect humans, according to researchers. In previous laboratory experiments, the microbe killed the borers in petrie dishes and sickened them when tested in a greenhouse, the company said. Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, said the pesticide hasn't been shown to work in greenhouse tests and has lowered corn yields during some tests.", " Researchers have discovered small quantities of a radioactive substance in material dredged from Savannah Harbor about 100 miles downstream from the Savannah River Plant. Cesium 137, a radioactive isotope, was found in material taken from the harbor and dumped on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River, which forms the border with Georgia. Tests found tiny amounts of the material, insufficient to create a health hazard, The Charleston News & Courier reported today. The tests were done for the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department by researchers at the University of Georgia. The wildlife agency is sampling dredged material for pollutants because of water quality problems believed to be caused by industrial discharges into the river, agency officials said. Cesium 137 is produced as a byproduct of nuclear fission, and is generally associated with radioactive waste. It emits beta and gamma radiation, both of which can produce a variety of ill effects, depending on the dosage. Lou Gordell, acting director of the U.S. Department of Energy's environmental division at the nuclear plant, said he had not been informed of the study results, but acknowledged Monday that the material probably originated at the Savannah nuclear plant. The complex near Aiken produces the radioactive materials plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons. The government-owned plant has been under scrutiny in recent months since it was revealed that a series of accidents at the site over the past 30 years went unreported to the public. Gordell said sediment tests in Savannah Harbor for a 1984 study showed traces of Cesium 137, and that recent monitoring upstream found similar traces both in the water and river sediment. Much of the material leaked from SRP apparatus in the 1950s, but some is the result of continued discharge into the river, Gordell said. The level of contamination is far below EPA's maximum allowable level for drinking water, he said. Savannah and Beaufort-Jasper counties pump water from the Savannah River for drinking water. Traces of tritium also are found in the river, but also are below the maximum allowable levels, Gordell said. Cesium 137, with a half-life of 30 years, persists in the environment longer than tritium, with a half-life of 12 years. A half-life is the time it takes half the atoms of a radioactive material to disintegrate. The Savannah Harbor is periodically dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to maintain its depth for the port of Savannah.", " Scientists today began innoculating an acre of corn stalks in the first field test of a genetically engineered microbe designed to combat the European corn borer, one of agriculture's most destructive pests. Although researchers have conducted other experiments of genetically altered materials in the environment, the tests of Cxc-Bt at the federal experimental station here are the first approved of a genetically altered ``plant vaccine,'' scientists and federal officials said. Proponents of the Crop Genetics International project call the testing a step toward an era of chemical-free pest control. The company's chief scientist, Peter Carlson, said today he hoped Cxc-Bt will have the effect of making the corn borer sick. But he said the main purpose of the test is to determine whether the pesticide will spread from plant to plant, an undesireable effect. The microbe works by attacking the alkaline stomach of corn borers, giving them ulcers. It doesn't affect humans because people's stomachs are acid and are unaffected by the Bt protein, according to researchers. In previous experiments in petrie dishes and in a greenhouse, the microbe killed the borers in the petrie dishes and sickened them when tested in the greenhouse. The pest costs American farmers $400 million annually. Critics worry that Cxc-Bt experiment could set a precedent and are concerned that genetically engineered materials could spread uncontrollably once released into the environment. Environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society and the Environmental Defense Fund, did not oppose the limited field tests begun today. Environmental experts said if their questions about spreading are answered with more tests, they may support the final product. The crucial question for environmental groups is whether there will be adequate testing and regulation because Cxc-Bt is just the beginning of a rush of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of similiar products, said Maureen Hinkle, the Audubon Society's director of agriculture policy. Only one other genetic crop protector, a microbe altered to fight frost, has been approved for field testing by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, said the pesticide hasn't been shown to work in greenhouse tests. Rifkin said today his organization did not oppose today's test because ``this product doesn't work. It does not kill corn borers. (The company's) evaluation data supplied to the EPA shows the product does not kill the insects. It poses no immediate threat because it doesn't work.''", " The discovery of two species of the daddy-longlegs insect family in Edgewood County Park may block a proposed 18-hole golf course. Both species are called the Edgewood Park harvestman, of Sitalcina minor. They live only in serpentine rock formations in the park's hills, and several conservationists want the habitate to be preserved. ``Constructing a golf course would wipe out the whole harvestmen populations,'' said Thomas F. Briggs, a science teacher at San Francisco Lowell High School. ``These are about the smallest daddy longlegs in the world,'' he added. Briggs discovered one of the species in 1983 and the other in 1985. Both have eight legs, and bright orange-red bodies that measure about 1 millimeter. Unlike spiders, daddy-longlegs do not spin webs. Along with Darrell Ubick, an entomologist, Briggs has submitted a proposal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service asking that the species discovered in 1983 be declared a federally protected creature, which could halt any development of their only known habitat. San Mateo County purchased the 468-acre site in 1980 from the state and has been attempting to build a golf course there for several years. ``This little spider is just another ploy to keep from having a golf course,'' said Barbara Kootz of nearby San Carlos, a golfer and leader of pro-development interests in the area.", " Fish farmers don't believe their crops are for the birds, but try telling that to a hungry duck, blackbird or heron. ``Birds are a costly problem where fish are cultured,'' says researcher Vickie D. Martin in a new Agriculture Department report. ``Waterfowl frequently blamed for heavy losses of fish at aquacultural facilities include diving ducks, herons, egrets, terns, gulls, kingfishers, blackbirds, ospreys and anhingas.'' These birds _ the diving ducks include grebes, cormorants and mergansers _ were described as ``voracious fish eaters'' that not only cause property loss and damage but can transmit diseases to fish stock. ``Due to fecal contamination and the fact that some of the fish they consumed are diseased, predatory birds may transmit diseases from pond to pond,'' she said. Moreover, when fish farmers attempt to guard against the airborne marauders, they can be frustrated because a majority of the birds are legally categorized as migratory and are protected under federal and state laws. Martin, a student at Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga., worked as an intern for the department's Economic Research Service the last two summers. Although there are no figures documenting bird predation by fish species and location, she said losses to birds have been reported on baitfish, catfish, shellfish, tropical fish and trout, and are greatest in the largest aquaculture states: Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California and Georgia. ``Baitfish, particularly minnows, are lost to blackbirds in the winter, cormorants in the fall and winter, and herons in the summer,'' Martin said. ``In the Northeast, herons prey on baitfish in the fall, while trout are harassed by grackles, kingfishers, herons, ospreys and occasionally owls during the spring, late summer and early fall.'' She added that diving ducks are the main bird threats to shellfish, although swans occasionally are problems. ``Catfish in the Southeast are preyed upon most by anhingas (locally called water turkeys) and kingfishers during the spring and summer months,'' Martin said. ``Herons and cormorants cause problems year-round. Crawfish and shrimp are prone to predation by purple grackles, herons, egrets, ibises, gulls, diving ducks and kingfishers.'' Fish ponds can be protected somewhat by barriers such as perimeter fencing, netting, overhead wires and other devices, including fireworks, exploders and similar items used to frighten birds. Some chemicals, such as Avitrol, a registered ``frightening agent'' for use on herring gulls and blackbirds, have also been effective, she said. But state and federal permits are required to use this chemical on gulls, because they are legally protected. After ingesting the chemical, the gull ``will behave erratically and emit distress calls,'' which frighten away the other birds, she said. Some migratory game birds may be shot during the hunting season, and other permits are available for some species. Local state and federal wildlife authorities should be contacted. Still, Martin said, some fish farmers believe ``birds are uncontrollable and that all frightening tactics are futile, no matter what method of control of prevention is used.''", " Wood storks have come home to roost in southern Florida, but but naturalists are worried that the endangered birds won't have a chance to rear their young before the rainy season. Summer deluges at the storks' two major ancestral breeding grounds would drench nestlings and disperse the fish the birds rely on for food, they explained. Last week, 620 pairs of wood storks were nesting at Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary, a National Audubon Society refuge about 20 miles north of Naples that was once the primary stork-nesting area in North America. Another 75 pairs have taken up residence at Everglades National Park's Cuthbert Island. The two sites were believed to have been all but abandoned by North America's sole species of stork, a giant white bird with an iron-black head. ``We are ecstatic to be able to report these numbers,'' said Paul Hinchcliff, chief naturalist at Corkscrew. ``Whether or not there's enough time before the start of the rainy season to fledge enough young remains to be seen.'' Almost all previous attempts to nest so late in the year have ended disastrously, said John Ogden, who heads a wood stork study team at Everglades National Park. If they are unable to feed offspring, parent birds will abandon the colony, leaving hundreds of crying young birds to starve. Wood storks have not produced offspring in significant numbers at Corkscrew since 1984-85, when 353 pairs of birds successfully raised 530 young. Fifty years ago, it was common to see 6,000 to 8,000 pairs of storks nesting in the gray-boughed cypress trees. Since the early 1960s, however, storks have been spurning Corkscrew in favor of central and northern Florida and other Southern states. Between 1960 and 1980, the wood stork nesting population at Corkscrew dropped by 75 percent. The renewed Corkscrew colony represents almost 30 percent of the total U.S. stork population, estimated at 4,000. Historically, storks came to Corkscrew by the tens of thousands to nest in early winter, leaving plenty of time to rear offspring before the onset of rain. But human activity disrupted the annual cycle of high-water summers and low-water winters in Florida's wetlands. Much of the area that provided shallow feeding waters for wood storks during the early winter has been drained for farming or sudivisions. The birds have been forced to wait until late winter or spring for the deeper waters of the interior Everglades to drop low enough for them to efficiently feed. As result, nesting is delayed, and this year's young won't be ready to leave their nests until about mid-July, Ogden said.", " At least two companies hired by the Energy Department as independent investigators of environmental and safety conditions at nuclear weapons plants are on the payroll at facilities they investigated, government records show. Others participating in the audits had bid for Energy Department contracts at sites they investigated, although they were not yet working there. Still others, while not associated with the plants they audited, are the Energy Department's prime contractors at other nuclear bomb factories. Written department guidelines for carrying out the ``independent tiger team'' investigations include a provision aimed at avoiding organizational conflicts of interest. It defines such a conflict as a situation in which a contractor ``has past, present or currently planned interests that either directly or indirectly ... may relate to the work to be performed'' and which may bias its judgment. The tiger teams were assembled by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins last summer to give an independent view of the plants' compliance with state and federal environmental, safety and health standards. The auditing work is meant to lay the groundwork for actions to correct unsafe and illegal practices at the plants. Virtually all 17 major weapons facilities have severe environmental problems; estimates of the cost of cleaning up production wastes are as high as $100 billion. Watkins publicly stressed the independence of the tiger teams but did not explain that many of the experts would be tied to the weapons business. The Energy Department, which owns the plants, declined to comment on whether the contractors' connections to the weapons industry amount to a conflict of interest that undermines the independence of the investigations or taints the findings. Department spokeswoman Catherine Kaliniak said the department would prefer to use its own employees for this work, ``but we don't have the people to do it.'' Each team is headed by a small number of department officials, but most of the scientific work is done by contract employees. Most have extensive backgrounds in nuclear environmental and safety matters. A review of department records as well as interviews with government and industry officials show that of the eight weapons plant investigations done last year, at least three involved companies that held other Energy Department contracts at the same sites or were bidding for contract work at those facilities. _The engineering and environmental consulting firm NUS Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md., was on the tiger team that investigated the Y-12 uranium processing plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn., last fall. According to department records, NUS at the same time was working for the Oak Ridge reservation on an environmental study of its nuclear and hazardous waste management. The Y-12 plant is one of several operations at the Oak Ridge reservation. NUS's Oak Ridge contract was awarded Nov. 8, 1988, and was valued at $1.4 million. The firm also holds contracts at weapons facilities in South Carolina and Idaho. NUS spokesman Don Couchman declined to discuss any aspect of the firm's work for the Energy Department. _Science Applications International Corp. of La Jolla, Calif., helped evaluate the Nevada Test Site, which conducts underground nuclear weapons tests. The company at the same time was working at the site under two Energy Department contracts with a combined value of $100 million. Most of its work is at a proposed high-level nuclear waste dump at the site that was not part of the tiger team audit. _ICF Kaiser Engineers, an engineering and construction company based in Oakland, Calif., participated in tiger team audits at the Nevada Test Site. ICF held no Energy Department contracts at the test site at the time of the investigation last November, but it was bidding for a $5 million job to help the facility's prime contractor, Reynolds Electrical & Engineering Co., Inc., develop and carry out an environmental cleanup program there. ICF Kaiser announced it won the contract 10 days after the on-site tiger team work ended Dec. 1. Similarly, records show the company participated in tiger team investigations at the Fernald uranium processing plant in Ohio and the Y-12 Oak Ridge plant while it was a bidder for major Energy Department contracts at both sites. The contract at Oak Ridge is valued at $505 million over five years, according to Bob Lynch, deputy director of the department's field office there. Marc Tipermas, executive vice president of ICF, said in a telephone interview that he saw no conflict of interest in his company's involvement in the tiger team work. He said he was not sure whether, in choosing ICF for the work, the department knew or cared about the company's other work at the weapons plants. ``In order to get this job done well and quickly, contractors had to be used,'' Tipermas said. ``Like many other companies, we were drafted. We were helter-skelter pulled onto these teams.'' The Energy Department has used private contractors to run the nuclear weapons plants since they were built as part of the World War II Manhattan Project that produced the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. The contracting system has left the department with little internal expertise in this area and a tendency to rely on the weapons makers to police themselves. Watkins strongly advocates hiring more federal employees with environmental, safety and health expertise to lessen the dependence on private contractors. Although the department insists that the tiger team members' links to the weapons industry do not compromise their objectivity as judges of environmental and safety conditions at the plants, some outside experts disagree. ``It's inevitably a potential conflict when a contractor is reviewing another contractor, and the reason is that any possible criticism of one contractor might lead to future business for another contractor,'' said Donald F. Kettl, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University and author of a book on government use of contractors. Other tiger team members included companies in charge of running nuclear weapons plants, though not the ones they investigated. These include EG&G Inc., which is the prime contractor at the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant near Denver, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory at Idaho Falls, which processes naval nuclear fuels, and the Mound Laboratory near Dayton, Ohio, which makes detonators for nuclear arms. Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs the Oak Ridge facilities, participated in some other audits, as did subsidiaries of Westinghouse Electric Corp., which runs several weapons sites, and Mason and Hangar Silas Mason Co., operator of the Pantex final weapons assembly plant near Amarillo, Texas.", " A deactivated reactor from the nation's first nuclear power plant will be floated down the Ohio River in October on its way to a nuclear waste depository in Washington state, officials said. The reactor, to be removed from the deactivated Shippingport Atomic Power Station about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, is expected to be unloaded in February at the Hanford nuclear reservation in south-central Washington. The barge will go down the Ohio to the Mississippi River, into the Gulf of Mexico, through the Panama Canal and up the Pacific Coast. Although the reactor has been emptied of its nuclear fuel, filled with concrete and enclosed in a neutron-shield tank, it's classified as nuclear waste since it has been contaminated by radiation. ``There has never been a plant this large decommissioned in this country,'' said David Ney, a nuclear engineer for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources. ``It's probably the largest single shipment of nuclear waste in the nation's history.'' Mike Molloy, executive director of Disaster and Emergency Services in Kentucky, said Thursday that his agency hasn't received word of the shipment to Hanford. Mike McKernan, a technology transfer program manager for Westinghouse-Hanford Co., said the company would inform states along the route when the loading date approaches. Westinghouse-Hanford is the federal Department of Energy's technical support contractor for Shippingport. The concrete-filled reactor and its enclosing shield, McKernan said, together about 1,000 tons and measures about 45 feet high and 18 feet across. ``You can stand on it all day long and you wouldn't come in contact with more radiation than if you were standing out in the sun,'' McKernan said. The plant, commissioned in 1957, was the nation's first commercial nuclear power plant. The federal Department of Energy and Duquesne Light, the Pittsburgh-based power company, operated the plant as a demonstration project. They began taking the plant out of service four years ago. By June, the nuclear core was removed and the middle of the reactor, which served as a heat source for water that was converted to steam, was filled with concrete. The Department of Energy is charged with disposing of the reactor and converting the property, owned by Duquesne Light, to ``a perfectly usable condition,'' McKernan said. Pennsylvania officials are monitoring the process.", " A Massachusetts company is making money out of garbage through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the refuse of a throwaway society. Public landfills are clogged with paper, glass, aluminum and plastic, and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of garbage produced yearly in the United States is recycled, according to David Spencer, president and founder of wTe Corp. in Bedford. His company develops methods for processing waste to recover ferrous metal and other substances. The company also runs trash-to-energy plants under contract with cities, and joined with such companies as Dow Chemical Co. to develop plastics recycling technology. At a research station at the University of California at Berkeley, wTe hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to separate components for recycling and energy conversion. Spencer, 44, believes recycling and recovery, which is the process of extracting certain components of trash, will become increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse, long the cheapest and easiest disposal method. ``Everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into the waste stream. ... It all winds up on a trash truck,'' Spencer said in a recent interview. ``To look at the increase in garbage, just look at the GNP.'' Spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are costly for cash-strapped municipalities, which must weigh such expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs. It often may be less expensive in the short run to bury garbage in a landfill, but in the long run ``yesterday's landfill is today's superfund site,'' he said. Spencer, who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science, is a Philadelphia native who, after attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, founded Waste Energy Technology Corp. in 1981. The name was changed to wTe in 1987. Now a $20 million, privately held company with 220 employees, wTe's operations include a waste-to-energy plant and recycling facility in Akron, Ohio, waste-recovery projects in Dade County, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio, and, through a subsidiary, a polystyrene recycling project in Brooklyn, N.Y. In Bedford, the company runs the city's curbside recycling program. Columbus has wTe under contract to use a magnetic process to extract ferrous metal from the city's waste stream before waste is burned in the city's incinerator. That makes the burning process less abrasive and wearing on city equipment. It also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left over, said Tim Barr, deputy director of Columbus public utilities. Ray Kapper, Akron director of public services, said wTe was brought in to run the city's waste-to-energy plant after problems with hazardous waste and an explosion in which three people died. Such plants burn waste to produce steam and other forms of energy. Under contract with Amoco Corp., wTe developed a process for the McDonald's Corp. chain to recycle polystyrene containers tossed away with half-eaten hamburgers and paper. The extracted material is turned into trays and other products for Rubbermaid Inc. Recycling methods can be environmentally benign. For example, discarded tires, long an urban eyesore, can be burned safely to create energy, Spencer says. The 300,000 to 500,000 tires discarded in Akron annually are shredded and fed into the waste-to-energy plant during winter, when people traditionally throw out less trash but energy needs are greater, he said. Spencer said his interest in recycling comes from a lifelong hatred of seeing anything go to waste. ``My mother used to get the squeak out of the pig, as they say,'' he said.", " A manufacturer of outdoor picnic equipment on Tuesday recalled hoses for 30,000 smoker-cookers because of possible fire hazards. The Coleman Co., Inc. recalled the hoses that connect to the propane gas tanks of its ``Cookin' Machines'' because they may loosen from the valve connection after repeated use, said the Consumer Product Safety Commission. ``If the hose should loosen when the valve is turned on, fuel may leak from the hose and could present a risk of personal injury or property damage if ignited,'' the agency said. There have been at least five reported incidents of loosened hoses causing fire damage, said the CPSC. The potentially hazardous hoses are installed on cookers manufactured by the Kansas-based company between November 1987 and March 1989. Consumers should discontinue use of the cookers immediately and contact Coleman at 1-800-835-3278 for instructions on free replacement of the hoses.", " Pope John Paul II on Thursday voiced support for a plan to combat rising anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe, but Vatican officials declined appeals by a Jewish delegation to recognize Israel. A Jewish leader, Seymour Reich, said two days of talks between the Jewish delegation and the Vatican marked ``the beginning of a new chapter'' in the Catholic-Jewish relationship. But he said delegates of the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations were ``somewhat disappointed'' the pope did not go further in his comments. The Vatican's new foreign minister, Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, cited the Vatican's traditional reasons for not recognizing Israel, including unsettled borders, the status of Jerusalem and the Palestinians' lack of a homeland. The pope hailed progress in relations between Jews and Catholics in his speech to the 30-member Jewish delegation and top Vatican officials. In particular, he praised a September plan drawn up by Jews and Catholics in Prague, Czechoslovakia, for fighting anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe. The six-point plan included calls for setting up courses for priests to counter anti-Jewish sentiment, and omiting religiously divisive material from textbooks. The Prague meeting also branded anti-Semitism a sin. Jewish leaders have expressed concern about an upsurge of anti-Semitism in the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, including the pope's native Poland. The pope praised the Prague meeting for coming ``to conclusions that are of great importance for the continuation of our dialogue and cooperation. It is my hope that these may be widely recognized and that the recommendations then formulated will be implemented wherever human and religious rights are violated.'' Besides the pope's endorsement for the plan to combat anti-Semitism, the Jewish delegation had sought the Vatican's formal recognition of Israel. But Reich, of Great Neck, N.Y., said they saw no change in the Vatican position on the Jewish State. Reich said the Jewish delegates told Vatican officials, ``there can be no full normalization of relations between the Catholic and Jewish communities until the Vatican has full normalization of relations with the Jewish state.'' Nevertheless, delegates said the one-hour papal meeting was warm. Lisa Palmieri-Billig of the Anti-Defamation League, quoted the pope as reiterating his wish to visit the Holy Land. ``I hope one day to be able to visit the holy sites, beginning with those of Abraham'' in Jerusalem, he said, according to Palmieri-Billig. ``That would be our joy,'' replied Rabbi David Rosen, according to Palmieri-Billig. Rosen is a representative of the Anti-Defamation League in Jerusalem. The Catholic-Jewish meetings were held to mark the 25th anniversary of Nostra Aetate, adopted during the Second Vatican Council. The document, considered a turning point in Catholic-Jewish relations, withdrew the accusation that the Jews were responsible for killing Christ.", " Pope John Paul II on Thursday met with a U.S. archbishop who had been punished by the Vatican for permitting homosexual gatherings and for other liberal practices objectionable to the Holy See. Seattle Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen came to Rome to fulfill the requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years and report on their dioceses. The Vatican's official bulletin listed the meeting without comment. Hunthausen could be not be reached for comment about his meeting with the pope. In 1985, the Vatican removed Hunthausen's authority in several major areas, after accusing him of being loose in granting marriage annulments and general absolution for sins as well as of allowing homosexuals to gather in church facilities. His authority was restored in 1987 and a coadjutor archbishop, Thomas Murphy, was named. While the disciplinary action was in force, an auxiliary bishop, Donald Wuerl, was assigned to wield the authority in those areas. While under discipline, Hunthausen denounced the split-authority arrangement as unworkable and humiliating. U.S. bishops, often at odds with the Vatican on such issues as sexuality, expressed dismay over the case. After Hunthausen's authority was restored, a three-member commission was appointed to work out remaining problems in the archdiocese.", " An Illinois pastor has been chosen to succeed Dr. Oswald Hoffman as speaker of ``The Lutheran Hour,'' an English-language program broadcast internationally over 1,300 radio stations each week. Dr. Dale A. Meyer will take over for Hoffman, who is retiring Dec. 31 after 33 years as the program's speaker. Governors of the International Lutheran Laymen's League selected Meyer during a meeting last weekend in St. Louis. Meyer, 41, has been pastor of Holy Cross Lutheran Church in Collinsville since 1984.", " Liberal Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen said Vatican officials have indicated he will regain full control of the Seattle archdiocese. Hunthausen, who returned Tuesday from a week in Rome, said he was ``hoping for some kind of a statement'' within weeks that will officially end the Vatican's direct assistance to the archdiocese. But a conservative Catholic group charged Wednesday that violations of church practices are continuing and said it will not let up in its criticism. ``I haven't seen a great change here,'' Margaret Hoffman, director of the Sons of St. Peter Coalition, said Wednesday. ``I've seen things happen currently that are not in line with church teaching. I think we as laymen have a duty to report abuses ... for the health of the church.'' Hunthausen's weeklong visit to Rome was to fulfill the requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years. The archbishop ran afoul of the Vatican in 1983 over the granting of annulments and general absolution of sins, intercommunion with Protestants and opening of churches to meetings of homosexual Catholics. A Vatican investigation resulted in the archbishop being stripped of much of his power. Although Hunthausen's full powers were restored in May 1987 on the recommendation of an apostolic commission appointed by Rome, the panel continued to assist in the operation of the Seattle archdiocese. Most recently, Hunthausen has shared authority with Coadjutor Archbishop Thomas J. Murphy, who accompanied Hunthausen to Rome to present Pope John Paul II and Vatican officials an overview of changes made and planned in the ministry. Hunthausen said there would be no visible changes in the way he handles the archdiocese's operations, now that some changes and clarifications have been made or at least initiated. An archdiocesan statement said Vatican officials also were told Hunthausen's critics appear ``bent on undoing the fabric of unity that exists among sincere and conscientious believers within the Body of Christ. ... In our judgment, their criticism ought not to be given serious attention.'' Hunthausen said Wednesday the ``small cadre'' of critics within the archdiocese are ``people with a different view of the church.'' ``We'd love to be able to find a way to minister to them,'' he said.", " Pope John Paul II has appointed Bishop Adam J. Maida of Green Bay, Wis., as the new archbishop of Detroit, the Vatican reported today. He succeeds Cardinal Edmund C. Szoka, who was named to a top financial post at the Vatican in January. The 60-year-old Maida, born in East Vandergrift, Pa., was promoted to the Green Bay post in November 1983.", " U.S. Roman Catholic bishops on Wednesday adopted their first comprehensive guidelines on human sexuality, portraying it in exalting terms and calling for it to be taught in Catholic schools. Against some opposition and attempts at delay, the document was approved by a strong voice vote by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. It says sexual education should be taught in schools and parishes as well as in families, a provision strongly opposed by several bishops who said many parents want such education kept in the home. One said families might remove their children from Catholic schools if sex education is required. Describing sexuality as a ``wonderful gift,'' the bishops say they approach the subject with a ``deep and abiding sense of appreciation, wonder and respect.'' They add: ``We are dealing with a divine gift, a primal dimension of each person, a mysterious blend of spirit and body, which shares in God's own creative love and life. ... ``Sexuality is a dimension of one's restless heart, which continually yearns for interpersonal communion, glimpsed and experienced to varying degrees in this life, ultimately finding full oneness only in God, here, and hereafter.'' The 185-page document, called ``Human Sexuality: A Catholic Perspective for Education and Lifelong Learning,'' was developed by a special task force, including experts in various fields. Auxiliary Bishop William Newman of Baltimore, said the effort was to present the subject in ``positive terms and with flow.'' Much of it has a lilting sweep in phrasing. ``We are created not as angels or pure spirits, but as human beings, embodied and sexual,'' the document says. ``The gift of sexuality involves the whole person because it permeates all facets of the human personality: the physical, the psycho-emotional, the intellectual, the spiritual and ethical and the social,'' the bishops say. ``Sexuality prompts each of us from within, calling us to personal as well as spiritual growth and drawing us out from self to interpersonal bonds and commitments with others, both women and men.'' The document affirms the church's traditional teaching that condones intercourse only in marriage. ``Like all our human powers and freedoms, sexuality can be channeled for good or ill ... can be abused, sometimes intentionally, sometimes through immaturity or ignorance... ``Given how important sexuality is ... such errors in judgment frequently have a profound impact for ill on ne's psyche, human commitments and relationship with God,'' it says. Bishop Kenneth E. Untener of Saginaw, Mich. noted the document mentions that some dissent from the church ban against contraception and urges they pray and reconsider. He said they might respond, ``We will if you will.'' Refering to widespread disagreement with the contraception ban among Catholics, he urged listening to them. ``If we don't, it will cause great damage to the church at large,'' he told fellow bishops, saying the church's credibility depended on it. Some bishops complained that many parents wanted sexual education kept in the home, and not taught in school. Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan of New York, protested that the document had been shaped without wide parental consultation. He sought unsuccessfully to get it tabled. He said if sexual education is required, many parents ``will pull their children out of Catholic schools.'' Considerable debate came on a section dealing with homosexuality, and a move was made to insert a 1986 Vatican declaration that homosexuality is an ``objective disorder'' involving a tendency to moral evil. However, Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco, said that the Vatican's philosophical analysis had been misinterpreted to mean ``the person was intrinsically disordered and intrinsically bad.'' The matter was put in a footnote, along with an explanation of the distinction between the technical and personal implications. ``Homosexual orientation, because it is not freely chosen, is not sinful,'' an added line said. The portion on teaching about sexuality focuses on the different stages of life, childhood, adolescence and adulthood. The bishops, on the third day of their four-day annual meeting, also approved a major aid program to long-suppressed churches of Eastern Europe. A national collection was to be made for three, and perhaps five years, to fund the operation. Asked how much was expected from such fund drives, Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis told a news conference,``Millions.'' He said other special drives have yielded more than $10 million annually.", " A leading Soviet Bible scholar said Wednesday a Soviet magazine plans to serialize the New Testament in an effort to boost its sales. ``At first, I was shaken by such an indecency,'' said Sergei S. Averintzev, ``but then I thought, it's good.'' Averintzev, 61, said he was commissioned to write footnotes to the New Testament, which is to be published in the magazine In the World of Books. He said a Soviet publishing house also was preparing a book edition of the New Testament with his notes. The scholar, who is in Israel with a delegation of Soviet filmmakers, is a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and has written books and articles on ancient Greek and Byzantine culture and the Bible. In a lecture at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Averintzev said said the magazine wanted to print the New Testament ``to enlarge its circulation.''", " Vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slurs at a Jewish cemetery in Rhode Island and in the office of a Jewish student organization in New York one day after a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht. ``I can't even find the word for it, it's so hurtful,'' James Oppenheim, president of the Jewish Student Union at the State University of New York at Binghamton, N.Y., said Thursday. There was no sign of forced entry at the office and sanctuary in the basement of the student union, Oppenheim said. The group has about 200 students that coordinate activities on the campus, which has about 5,000 Jewish students. ``I think it's politically motivated because they didn't do any damage that we can see,'' Oppenheim said. Police were taking fingerprints in the rooms but had no suspects, said Raymond Dye, vice president of student affairs. On Wednesday night the Jewish group sponsored a candlelight vigil to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night the Nazis began their first organized assaults against the Jews in Germany and Austria. In Woonsocket, R.I., vandals painted swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans at a 95-year-old Jewish cemetery, but police were uncertain whether the attack was related to Kristallnacht observances. A woman visiting B'nai Israel Cemetery Tuesday found her son's headstone among the approximately half-dozen covered with swastikas and other Nazi symbols. The main road to the cemetery also had been inscribed with anti-Jewish slogans and the German word for Jew, ``Juden.'' ``Today when I went to the cemetery, it was a very terrible reminder of things that have happened to us in the past,'' Temple B'nai Israel President Edith Wittes told those assembled for a Kristallnacht memorial service. In addition to the Nazi symbols, there were other images with possible links to Satanic worship, such as skulls and an inverted cross with its arms turned down. ``The sickness that made Adolf Hitler possible is alive and well today, in our own community,'' said Rabbi Joel Chernikoff.", " The Roman Catholic Church asked court permission to open a grave in an old church cemetery to make sure it holds the remains of Pierre Toussaint, a onetime slave from Haiti who could become the first black American saint. ``We want to be certain that what's down there is not sticks and stones and someone else's bones,'' said Monsignor Robert O'Connell, who is directing the campaign to canonize Toussaint. On Thursday, the archdiocese of New York sought the order from state Supreme Court. Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob scheduled a hearing for Aug. 28 and pronounced the matter ``utterly fascinating. ... This is much more interesting than Trump.'' Although the Health Department routinely issues permits to unearth buried coffins _ mostly so they can be moved from one cemetery to another _ anyone who wants to actually open a coffin must obtain a court order. Those present when the coffin is opened, including pathologists, church officials and gravediggers, ``must take an oath to testify truthfully to what they saw,'' O'Connell said. Church officials do not expect to find any supernatural evidence of Toussaint's sainthood, such as an unusually well-preserved corpse, he said. Toussaint apparently was buried 137 years ago in the cemetery of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan's Little Italy. The grave bears several markers, but O'Connell said that ``if he is declared a saint, and there is a ceremony honoring him, we must be sure.'' He said there was another reason for positive identification: If Toussaint becomes a saint, the Vatican may distribute some of his bones or personal items to ``places where his faith was nourished,'' such as Haiti, or to prominent places of worship such as St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. Toussaint was born a slave in Haiti in 1766, and moved to New York with his owner's family in 1787. He became one of the city's leading hairdressers, and was allowed to keep some of his income. When Toussaint's owner died, leaving his wife and child impoverished, Toussaint secretly supported them for about 20 years. The widow freed Toussaint shortly before her death in 1807. Toussaint gave lavishly to several charities, including an orphanage and the city's first school for black children, and entered quarantined sections of the city each August to help yellow fever victims. But he took no stand on slavery, and seems generally to have avoided controversy; according to a pamphlet released by the archdiocese: ``The famous phrase, `Only my hairdresser knows for sure,' could well have had its origin in Pierre's discretion.'' When Toussaint died in 1853, the New York Post said he was ``spoken of by all who know him as a man of the warmest and most active benevolence.'' O'Connell said the case for Toussaint's sainthood is buttressed by one reported miracle: the recovery of a young Haitian with cancer who refused medical care and relied solely on prayers to Toussaint. Even if Toussaint is deemed worthy of sainthood, canonization could be years away. Cardinal John O'Connor has said he hopes Toussaint might be near sainthood by the time Pope John Paul II visits Haiti in 1992, but O'Connell said he was told by Vatican officials that no timetable could be set.", " The all-male Cosmos Club, whose members once included Supreme Court Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis D. Brandeis, is about to vote for the third time in its 110-year history on admitting women. But for the first time, the leadership of the club has unanimously endorsed the idea. Members of the club are scheduled to vote Saturday afternoon, and although no one will say for certain how the vote will come out, club President Tedson J. Meyers said the question of whether to admit women has become the main topic of conversation among members. Meyers, a lawyer and former member of the City Council in Washington, said that the club currently has about 3,000 to 3,100 members, down several hundred in the past few years. But Meyers denied that the vote on admitting women has anything to do with the decline in membership. ``Membership seems to go up and down,'' he said. Meyers also denied that the vote Saturday is a direct result of a ruling last fall by the Washington Human Rights Office that ``there is probable cause to believe'' that the club's men-only policy violates the city's anti-discrimination law. The office is ready to order public hearings on the case, which could result in the loss of all city licenses and permits, if the all-male policy stays in place. ``It's a matter the club would have taken up in any event,'' Meyers said, although he acknowledged that the Human Rights Office's action did act as a catalyst. And while Meyers confirmed that a Committee of Concerned Members, formed in 1980 to advocate the admission of ``distinguished women,'' still exists, he said that it was not the committee that had put forth the latest proposal to admit women. ``This is the first time the officers and the board of directors brought the proposal forward,'' Meyers said. ``They unanimously endorsed it. They always opposed the idea before.'' The club, located in a mansion on the city's so-called Embassy Row, first voted on whether to admit women in 1973, after 61 members signed a petition proposing that women be allowed to join. The proposal was killed by a 274-203 vote. Again, in 1974, 50 members called for a vote on admitting women. The vote in this round was 407-204 against the proposal. A two-thirds majority is needed to change the club's bylaws, Meyers said. He pointed out that women can, and do, use the club. Female guests of members, as well as wives and widows of members and former members, are allowed to dine in the downstairs dining rooms. But women are not allowed in the second-floor members dining room, except on Thursday and Friday evenings and weekends. Members of the club have included Cabinet members, Pulitzer Prize and Nobel Peace Prize winners. Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun was a member for 18 years, but resigned last winter. The club was founded by geologist John Wesley Powell in 1878 and originally met in Powell's living room. It now charges a $900 initiation fee and $900 in annual dues.", " Negotiators for Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers will sign their new 66,000-worker, two-year contract on Monday, the last flourish on a pact that has been in effect since May 16. UAW President Owen Bieber, UAW Vice President Marc Stepp and Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, along with the elected 10-member UAW bargaining committee, will sign the contract in a 4 p.m. ceremony at Chrysler's Highland Park headquarters, company and union officials said. In ratification voting May 11, the contract was approved by a slim 54 percent of those voting overall and rejected by Chrysler's 10,000 skilled trades workers. But the contract was ratified later that week by the UAW's executive board following a skilled trades council meeting in Chicago because the skilled trades objections were not based on issues that applied solely to them. The contract has been in effect since May 16, replacing a three-year pact that would have expired Sept. 14, St. John said. Like the General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. pacts on which it is based, the contract guarantees a set number of jobs at each plant, warehouse or office except in cases of cuts in production volume because of slow sales. It also requires the corporation to recall or hire one worker for every two who quit, retire or die. In turn, UAW leaders agreed to end their resistance to plant-level agreements that organize workers into teams. Chrysler has begun taking its initial snapshot of guaranteed jobs at most locations; local union officials will be given lists of workers' names for approval and discussion, St. John said. Unlike the Ford and GM pacts, the Chrysler contract also covers salaried workers including engineers, office and clerical employees and nurses. The two sides began early negotiations April 18 in an effort to ease building tensions sparked by Chrysler's consideration of a $2 billion offer to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary and Chrysler's decision to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis. Chrysler backed down from the sale and agreed to early talks in March. Despite several disruptions that nearly prompted the UAW to break off talks, Chrysler and the union reached a tentative agreement May 4. The early settlement eliminated the chance of a strike in September, which observers said would have been very likely because of the accumulating anger among Chrysler workers. The new contract expires in 1990, making it the first Chrysler contract in a decade to expire simultaneously with the Ford and GM pacts.", " National contract talks between the United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp. continued Tuesday after a union executive told local leaders to prepare the troops for a strike. Negotiators were working against a midnight Friday deadline to reach a national contract covering about 300,000 active GM workers. UAW contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. also expire at the same time, but the union has chosen GM as its target for a strike. In all, more than 450,000 active auto workers are covered by UAW contracts with the Big Three automakers. The union's main bargaining goal is job security, and a union telephone recording said Tuesday that little progress had been made on that issue. ``The corporation must become more serious in their attitude,'' said UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, in charge of the union's GM bargaining team. He told local union leaders they should be ready for a strike. ``I trust that you will do everything necessary to prepare the membership for a disciplined response to whatever action is required in the difficult days ahead,'' Yokich said. The last time the UAW struck GM over a national contract was in 1984, when the union staged a weeklong walkout at 12 assembly plants and the company's Technical Center in Warren, Mich. This year, members of UAW Local 659 at GM's AC Rochester West component plant in Flint staged a six-day strike that shut down seven assembly plants and parts of more than a dozen component factories. ``We haven't heard hardly anything,'' said UAW Local 662 Vice President Larry Howerton of Anderson, Ind. ``We're going to have to hear something pretty soon. We've got to be notified.'' There has been little news coming out of the talks this year. UAW and GM officials have been available to media only occasionally and when they have appeared, they rarely talked about contract details. They have preferred instead to say both sides were working hard and there still was time to reach an agreement before the deadline. So far, union officials have said tentative agreements have been reached on nearly all non-economic issues, such as military leave and jury duty provisions. But the economic issues, which include job security, are the tough ones. The UAW leadership has a strong strike authorization vote under its belt, clearing the way for it to call a strike against GM if an agreement cannot be reached.", " Chrysler Corp. workers, anxious to receive the same benefits that General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. workers received in new contracts last fall, are preparing contract demands for talks beginning April 18. Members of the United Auto Workers union's 140-member national Chrysler council were to begin arriving in Kansas City, Mo., today for a meeting with national UAW leaders and elected union bargainers. By Friday, the council planned to have discussed and approved demands that will guide how the industry pattern contract, established at the two larger companies, can be installed at the smallest Big Three automaker. The Chrysler contract, covering 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers, expires Sept. 14. Talks are scheduled to begin April 18, instead of mid-July as usual. The two sides agreed to early talks to stem damage inflicted by friction over Chrysler's closing of an assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., and the abortive sale of its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary. Chrysler was stunned by the speed and severity of the union's opposition to the proposed Acustar sale. Angry workers at locals across the nation began preparing ``strike packages'' _ lists of grievances over locally strikeable issues _ and stopped cooperating in crucial management-union programs aimed at improving quality and production efficiency. UAW Vice President Marc Stepp, who will lead negotiations with Chrysler, told workers at the time that he would give local unions with grievances permission to strike immediately. A few strikes at key assembly and parts plants could have crippled Chrysler as quickly as a national strike. Chrysler quickly backed down from the proposed sale in early March and agreed to early contract talks, a request it had refused last fall after the union wrapped up contracts at Ford and GM. Negotiators on both sides are limited to working within the pattern contract, which forbids layoffs except during declining sales of a particular product and requires automakers to continue paying workers whose jobs are lost to productivity improvements, new technology or transfer of work to outside suppliers. The pattern contract also includes joint six-month, plant-by-plant studies that will examine ways to strengthen operations and keep work inside each company. The UAW hopes the studies will make it harder for automakers to pit plant against plant in competition for a shrinking number of jobs. The UAW is expected to seek a two-year contract instead of the usual three-year pact so that its contracts with all Big Three makers will expire together in 1990. The union also will seek more representation on the Chrysler board of directors. UAW President Owen Bieber has a board seat, but the union believes holding more seats will give it more control over Chrysler decisions. Bargainers will work against an artificial target deadline instead of a strike deadline, so Chrysler faces no risk of a companywide strike if talks fail. Industry analysts expect a quick settlement. But a failure at the table would sour relations and make talks more difficult when the two sides were forced to resume bargaining in the summer.", " State high-school teachers have voted to boycott university entrance exams, endangering the chances of thousands of students who have applied to enter universities in Greece and abroad. The Federation of Higher Education Personnel, which represents nearly 60,000 high-school teachers nationwide, overwhelmingly voted Thursday to continue a strike over pay and conditions. ``We will stage 24-hour strikes whenever the government reschedules the exams,'' said one union official, who refused to be identified. The exams conducted by the state high-school teachers were originally set for June 14. The teachers want $107 more a month in pay and a reduction in the number of hours they must teach each week. High-school teachers receive a starting salary of about $476 a month, which can rise to $833 a month. They must teach 21 hours each week and want that cut to 18 hours a week.", " Chrysler Corp. will shut down its car assembly plant in St. Louis and lay off 3,700 workers in a move that's likely to worsen already souring relations between the company and its union. Thursday's announcement, the latest in a series of moves by U.S. automakers to cut capacity in the face of slumping sales, makes it likely that job security will be the union's top priority when it opens contract negotiations with the nation's Big Three automakers this summer. Chrysler said its St. Louis No. 1 plant will close Sept. 21, one week after its existing contract with the United Auto Workers expires. As previously announced, Chrysler will eliminate one shift at the plant on Feb. 12. The company said it will transfer production of the Dodge Daytona to its Sterling Heights, Mich., assembly plant, and shift assembly of the Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible to its Newark, Del., plant. The St. Louis plant will be the third Chrysler has closed since late 1988. It was announced just one day before the company closes a Detroit plant and puts 1,700 other workers on indefinite layoff. The move angered United Auto Workers officials. ``Workers and their unions don't design the cars or develop the marketing plans,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and Vice President Stan Marshall, head of the union's Chrysler department, said in a statement. ``Senior management calls those shots, but when they miscalculate or screw up, they all stay in place while the workers are told to hit the street,'' they said. Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said the timing of the St. Louis plant closing was dictated by the UAW contract, which expires Sept. 14. That pact doesn't allow the company to close a plant because of product transfers. It says plants may be shut down only if sales of its products slump badly. Chrysler used that as justification for today's closing of its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit. That factory makes Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars, whose sales have fallen by more than 50 percent from their heyday of about 208,000 in 1986. The UAW has contested that closing, saying Chrysler didn't do enough to keep the design of the small cars fresh and market them properly. Some of the 1,700 workers laid off from Jefferson Avenue will be offered jobs at Jefferson North, a plant under construction next to the existing factory. That plant will begin producing a sport-utility vehicle in late 1992. Chrysler is shutting the St. Louis plant in two stages. Beginning Feb. 12, it will eliminate one shift, putting 1,900 of its 3,700 workers on indefinite layoff. In September, it will lay off the remaining 1,800 workers and close the plant. The announcement couldn't have come at a worst moment, said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California at San Diego. ``I think this coming on top of Jefferson is going to create a lot of anxiety and hostility in the industry going into negotiations,'' he said. The UAW opens talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler in July. UAW President Owen Bieber said negotiating priorities will be worked out at a special union convention in May in Kansas City, Mo., but job security was more than likely to be the top issue. Michigan State University labor professor Dale Brickner agreed. ``Job security is going to be the barn burner,'' Brickner said. ``If we had strikes this fall, one or more, it certainly would not surprise me.'' Nicoll, the Chrysler spokesman, said the Delaware and Michigan plants would be idled in November to retool for the new cars and would resume production in December. Employment at each plant will increase by a few hundred workers, with laid off St. Louis workers getting the first cracks at the new jobs. The St. Louis closing is one in a series of temporary or indefinite shutdowns or production cuts at Big Three assembly plants nationwide. About 15,400 workers will have lost their jobs at 11 GM or Chrysler assembly plants because of indefinite layoffs between January and September. ``This isn't the last,'' Shaiken said. ``I think we will see something else at GM, particularly as contract time approaches.'' The closures come as auto sales slump and capacity at Japanese-owned plants grows. Within the last year, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. has opened a second assembly plant in Ohio and Nissan Motor Corp. has announced a huge expansion of its factory in Smyrna, Tenn. Since 1986, the best year in automotive sales history, GM and Chrysler have lost market share while Ford and Japanese companies, with the help of their new U.S. plants, have increased their shares.", " Some 2,200 registered nurses from six hospitals will return to work this week after ending a four-week strike that at one point involved 4,000 nurses from eight hospitals, union officials said. Of the 1,200 California Nurses Association members who voted Sunday, 77 percent approved a new contract, which offers a 21 percent wage increase over 34 months. The pact differs little from one rejected 11 days ago. The nurses are set to return to work on Wednesday, said CNA spokeswoman Maureen Anderson. Although 10 other hospitals were unaffected by the walkout, hundreds of patients were inconvenienced as some of the struck medical facilities closed emergency rooms, delayed surgeries and consolidated many other services. While many nurses weren't elated with the agreement, they said they demonstrated labor solidarity. ``We've put this message out to the hospitals: That nurses are serious about the issues facing them and we intend to be listened to,'' said Mary Scheib, a CNA nurse at Mt. Zion Hospital. ``We're going to be continuing our efforts (to improve pay and working conditions) when we go back to work,'' she added. ``Today is really day one of organizing for 1991, when the contract expires.'' A proposed CNA contract voted down Aug. 19 by a 2-1 margin offered 20 percent over 36 months. CNA went into the strike Aug. 2 demanding a 21 percent wage increase over two years. Karen Henry, chief negotiator for Affiliated Hospitals, the group representing the affected medical facilities, said Sunday that the CNA contract ``accomplished the hospitals' bargaining objectives.'' She defined that mainly as avoiding large pay raises in a two-year period. Under the CNA contract, a dayshift nurse at top scale will make $21.99 an hour by the end of the contract, or $45,700 annually. The 1,700 members of Local 250 of the Hospital and Health Care Workers Union, who went on strike July 26, began returning to work Wednesday. They walked out mainly over health benefits. CNA's negotiating committee unanimously endorsed the latest contract. The latest proposal was an unsolicited offer submitted Friday to Affiliated. The two sides had not met at the bargaining table for nearly a week. CNA nurses struck at Children's, Marshal Hale, St. Mary's, St. Francis and Mount Zion hospitals in San Francisco and Seton Medical Center in Daly City. Local 250 accepted a contract last week that provides up to 6 percent pay raises for nurses and some other hospital workers over two years. Some other workers will not receive raises, but bonuses ranging up to $300 by the end of the contract. About 100 nurses and service workers remain on strike at French Hospital, where talks have been held separately. A settlement there is expected to be routine.", " Brown University and its food service, plant operations and library workers reached a contract agreement on Wednesday just hours before a midnight strike dedline. After two days of negotiations, the Ivy League school agreed to pay full health insurance premiums for members of Local 134 of the Service Employees International union. ``We feel that we have a great victory here,'' said Karen McAninch, the union's business agent.``The important thing is we got 100 percent Blue Cross coverage for the life of the agreement.'' A three-year contract for the 250 plant and food workers provided a 5.5 percent pay increase in the first year and a 5 percent increase in the remaining two years. The 90 library workers received a two-year contract that gave them a 5.5 percent increase in the first year and a 5 percent raise in the second. The contract was ratified by a show of hands by the plant and food workers and by a 50-21 vote from the library workers, McAninch said. The workers earlier this month authorized a strike for midnight Wednesday, when the contract covering plant and food workers expires. The contract for the library workers expired on Aug. 19. ``Both sides gave substantially in the interest of harmony to get the matter resolved,'' said Robert Reichley, a university spokesman. ``In the long run it may not be the best solution for both sides, but at least it averted a strike.'' On Tuesday, Brown officials offered a higher wage increase, but said they would pay only half the insurance premiums for the first year and 60 percent of following increases. McAninch said the principle of cost shifting was as important as the numbers. ``They knew that we were serious about striking and that we felt very strongly about the issues,'' she said. ``We had a lot of support from Brown University students.''", " United Mine Workers strikers won concessions on health care and pension benefits and Pittston Coal Group got the ability to run its mines almost nonstop in a proposed settlement distributed to miners today. If approved by the UMW's rank-and-file in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, the settlement could resolve the union's bitter and sporadically violent 10{-month strike against the nation's largest coal exporter by next week. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed contract from a source who insisted on anonymity. Since Pittston and the union negotiators reached agreement on New Year's Eve, they have kept contract details secret while both sides moved to dismiss lawsuits and fines stemming from the strike. UMW President Richard Trumka announced Thursday that union members would vote on the pact Monday, despite $64 million in fines pending in a Virginia state court for illegal strike activity. More than 2,000 union members packed into a building at the Russell County Fairgrounds this morning to receive copies of the 49-page contract, listen to pep talks by the union's top officers and receive a briefing on the terms. Trumka choked back tears as he congratulated the miners on what he said was a successful strike. ``I'm proud. I'm proud you did this,'' Trumka said as he raised the contract in the air to a round of applause. Some miners grumbled about terms in the contract but most gave it a favorable review. ``There's some good, some bad,'' said Jack Hale, a 48-year-old laid-off miner. ``We'll just have to weigh the good against the bad.'' The proposal in many respects mirrors health and pension benefits contained in the 1988 Bituminous Coal Operators Association contract, the industry's national labor contract. But it differs in two significant respects: Pittston won the ability to hire contract truck drivers and maintenance workers, as long as union miners are not laid off in the process. And the company would be able to run its mines around-the-clock and seven-days-a-week, except for Christmas and the Sunday day shift. Wages were not a major issue in the strike. But miners would receive a cumulative $1.20-an-hour raise at the end of three years. Top-scale hourly pay in selected positions would be $17.52. Pittston dropped out of the health-care plan negotiated between the union and the BCOA and spurred the strike by proposing payment of 80 percent of the covered medical expenses rather than 100 percent. The UMW won its demand to maintain 100 percent medical coverage for employees, pensioners and their families. The contract has a new health-cost containment provision in which Pittston issues $500 twice-a-year to each miner and pensioner under the age of 65 to cover their deductibles. After it dropped out of the BCOA, Pittston stopped contributing to the multi-employer retirement fund and promised to take care of its own retirees. It now has agreed to go back to the union pension fund. ``Pension benefits in the new contract are identical to those contained in the 1988 national agreement,'' according to a contract summary. The company wanted to be able to contract out work in five job categories but won the limited right in two areas: transportation of coal and repair and maintenance work. The company wanted to eliminate a provision that union contracts are not broken when a union mine changes hands or is conveyed from one subsidiary to another. But the settlement retains the successorship provision in the 1984 agreement and contains ``strengthened protection for UMWA members against internal company reorganization and shifting of coal lands,'' the contract said. Pittston's significant victory was its request to establish round-the-clock operations. During negotiations, the company dropped its original demand for a Sunday day shift, with four 10-hour shifts a week instead of five eight-hour shifts and the ability to call in workers for ``reasonable overtime'' with 12 hours notice, on a mandatory basis. The UMW wanted to stick with its traditional fixed five-day work week. The contract contains two ``flextime'' work schedules in addition to the regular work week. The flextime allows the company to work continuously. Pittston did not want to reinstate miners convicted of strike-related felonies. The UMW wanted all miners reinstated. A mention of the issue could not be found in the labor agreement.", " Lockheed Corp., the nation's eighth largest defense contractor, reached a tentative labor agreement with the union representing about 20,000 workers for the aerospace firm. The tentative contract reached early Sunday still must be ratified by rank and file members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A nationwide vote was scheduled for March 4. ``We feel it's the best contract that we can negotiate at this time, especially with government audits,'' union negotiator Bob Gregory said Sunday, referring to government monitoring of Lockheed's hourly compensation costs. Tom Goff, spokesman for the Calabasas-based Lockheed, confirmed that the two sides had reached a tentative agreement. A week earlier, union members rejected management's latest offer by a 98 percent margin. The union said Lockheed's earlier offer was inadequate and set up a two-tier wage structure. As part of the tentative agreement, both sides declined to disclose terms of the contract until the rank-and-file votes. The union workers have been operating under an extension of the previous three-year contract that expired last October. The present contract offer will be retroactive to October and runs through March 1, 1993, Gregory said. The union's Local District 727 represents 6,000 workers in Burbank and Palmdale. The contract also covers workers at Lockheed plants in Sunnyvale and Marietta, Ga. Contract talks had resumed Thursday in Florida and concluded early Sunday. Asked about changes in the contract offer's pension plan, Gregory said that it establishes an employee stock ownership plan for union members. Lockheed set up an employee stock-ownership plan for salaried employees last April. The plan, designed to strengthen the company against take-over attempts, gave salaried workers control of 17 percent of the company.", " Chrysler Motors Corp. on Tuesday named Thomas Stallkamp chairman and Forest Farmer president of its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary. Stallkamp assumes the title previously held by Bob Lutz, chairman of Acustar and of Chrysler Motors, the automaking arm of Chrysler Corp. Lutz remains chairman of Chrysler Motors and a member of the corporation's board. Stallkamp joined Chrysler Motors in 1980 as a general purchasing agent and moved to Acustar last June as vice president for marketing and procurement. Farmer succeeds Lee H. Runk, who resigned Monday to become president of the St. Louis-based Harvard Industries, an auto parts supplier. Farmer has been with Chrysler for 20 years and has held a number of managerial positions. He most recently was general plants manager for car and truck assembly operations. Acustar, created last year as Chrysler spun off its parts operations, employs about 28,000 hourly and salaried personnel and runs 30 factories nationwide.", " Atlantis' five astronauts on Thursday successfully completed a test that simulated an engine start and cut off moments before liftoff, NASA said. The shuttle is scheduled for a secret military mission in mid-July. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the two-day drill went smoothly. The countdown clock was stopped at four seconds before the mock liftoff. On Monday, Atlantis was moved from the hangar to the launch pad previously occupied by Columbia. Columbia was returned to the hangar last week for repair of a hydrogen leak that has delayed the shuttle's astronomy mission until at least mid-August. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to conduct a special tanking test on Wednesday, partly filling Atlantis' external tank with super-cold liquid hydrogen to make sure there are no leaks. A similar test was performed on Columbia a week after a hydrogen leak was detected during fueling for a May 30 launch. A launch date for Atlantis will be set at the conclusion of a two-day flight readiness review on June 28 and 29.", " NASA opened Discovery's payload bay doors Saturday to remove the Hubble Space Telescope's batteries for recharging and to replace a faulty part in preparation for an April 25 launch. Technicians took out a faulty auxiliary power unit responsible for grounding the shuttle last week. A new unit was being installed to be tested Sunday and fired up briefly later this week. ``We haven't run into any problem,'' said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``We're looking good for the 25th.'' Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries will be recharged for 5{ days in a laboratory at the Vehicle Assembly Building. NASA decided to take the batteries there because they can be recharged at a cooler temperature and thus retain more power. ``We will have a higher capacity in them than we would have had we been recharging at the pad,'' said Fred Wojtalik, a NASA project manager. ``This will make the opportunities for additional launch days a lot easier for us.'' The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from the shuttle's power system during deployment until its energy-collecting solar panels are unfurled. Discovery was poised for launch Tuesday, but the mission was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff when the auxiliary power unit failed. NASA was not sure how long it would take to replace the 88-pound unit because the procedure had never been performed before at the launch pad. The work went smoothly, Malone said. The defective power unit was returned to the manufacturer, Sunstrand Corp. of Rockford, Ill., for testing. The shuttle's three auxiliary power units pressurize the hydraulic system, which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking and steering systems. NASA planned to close Discovery's payload bay doors Sunday as soon as the lengthy process of removing the batteries was completed. The chamber will remain sealed to reduce the risk of getting too much dust on the telescope's 94-inch mirror, the finest ever made, until the batteries are returned next weekend. The $1.5 billion telescope is NASA's most expensive and complex payload. Once it is in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere, it will be able to detect objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best observatory on the ground. Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years, close to the beginning of the universe.", " With Magellan safely in orbit around Venus today, exuberant NASA engineers started preparing the spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped the landscape of the hellishly hot planet. ``We think we'll see lots of rocky surfaces, hills and dales and volcanoes,'' said Bill Johnson, chief engineer for Magellan's radar imaging system. Geologists hope the $744 million exploration will reveal ``the way the planet works internally, the way mountains are built and the way volcanoes work,'' said Steve Saunders, chief Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The mapping is set to start next month. On Friday, Magellan plunged over the north pole of Venus, fired its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges from about 171 miles to 5,054 miles above the planet's surface. ``We made it!'' said Carolynn Young, a Magellan project team member. ``I had goose bumps from head to toe. It's wonderful.'' The spacecraft successfully jettisoned the retrorocket Friday night, laboratory spokesman Bob MacMillin said. He said engineers' plans for today included monitoring Magellan's performance and collecting precise information on its orbit _ details needed for successful mapping. Magellan's arrival at Venus broke a string of bad luck for NASA. Hydrogen gas leaks have grounded the shuttle fleet temporarily and a mirror focusing flaw severely impaired the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Magellan is equipped with radar designed to peer through the thick Venusian clouds and unveil the landscape of the second planet from the sun. On Sept. 1, it will start mapping by bouncing radar waves off Venus and capturing the echoes. NASA said the radar should be able to yield pictures and maps of about 90 percent of Venus at a level of detail 10 times better than in images produced by two Soviet Venera spacecraft that were launched in 1983. It should be able to detect features as small as about two football fields. ``It's like going to the Grand Canyon instead of having someone tell you about it,'' mission analyst Rob Lock said. Magellan project manager Tony Spear said some worthwhile pictures of Venus' surface may be produced by radar tests that start next Thursday, but ``it is most likely in September ... that we will get images of sufficient quality.'' Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, starting a roundabout 948-million-mile journey to Venus. It met the planet at a distance of 144 million miles from Earth. Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor other than the moon, and is similar to Earth in size, mass, density and position. Magellan may reveal similarities and differences between the two planets, including whether any of Venus' volcanoes are active and whether its surface features are formed by large-scale movements of gigantic plates of rocky crust. It also will look for signs that the bone-dry planet may have had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Saunders said Magellan has no ability to determine what caused global warming on Venus, but may find clues to when it started. Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science, called Magellan's arrival at Venus ``the beginning of one of the most exciting eras of planetary exploration'' _ a period that includes upcoming missions to Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, asteroids and comets. Magellan was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since Pioneers 12 and 13 were sent to Venus in 1978, and also the first launched from a shuttle. Magellan, named for 16th century global circumnavigator Ferdinand Magellan, is 21 feet long and 15 feet wide. After firing the heavy fuel-filled braking rocket, its 3.7-ton weight dropped to less than 1.5 tons, Spear said.", " NASA scientists rejoiced at ``pretty damn good'' test photos from the Magellan probe today but also grappled with communications difficulties as the spacecraft circled Venus. Fifteen hours after the spacecraft lost contact with Earth on Thursday evening, the signal was re-established. But the signal failed again at midday and was expected to continue to be a problem until scientists could send Magellan new instructions on how to properly aim at Earth, officials said. Meanwhile, project manager Tony Spear said the test pictures collected from the spacecraft's radar mapper before the problems developed had produced ``some raw images that looked pretty damn good.'' He said NASA will release the first pictures on Monday instead of waiting until September. Thursday's test returned far more pictures than expected, including several so-called ``noodles,'' or areas of the planet about 1,000 miles long by 15 miles wide, project scientist Steve Saunders said. The pictures show ``lava flows and faults and fractures and cinder cones with craters in the top,'' Saunders said. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory were concerned when they did not hear from Magellan as expected at 8:32 p.m. Thursday. But they stressed that the spacecraft is loaded with computer programs that automatically help it find Earth if contact is lost. Originally, scientists had expected that the outage would continue until this evening. But late this morning, as scientists were were conducting a news conference about the problem, Magellan manager Steve Wall rushed in with word that NASA's Deep Space Network station at Goldstone, Calif., had re-established contact with the spacecraft and locked onto its signal. ``It is Magellan,'' Wall said. ``The spacecraft looks healthy.'' The second loss of contact a short time afterward was not entirely unexpected, Spear said. Scientists now expect the spacecraft to be in and out of touch until controllers can send it new instructions on how to properly aim at Earth, he said. However, the second signal loss blunted some of the sense of relief at hearing from Magellan after the overnight silence. Wall said engineers had been out of contact with the spacecraft Thursday night as it fixed on two stars, a procedure Magellan routinely performs to make sure it is pointed properly. NASA should have heard from Magellan at 8:32 p.m. PDT Thursday when this ``star calibration'' was completed, but ``we did not re-establish contact,'' JPL spokesman Jim Doyle said. The last previous radio contact with the craft had been at Deep Space Network stations at Goldstone and in Australia. ``The assumption is that after it made a star calibration, it looked at the wrong star and then couldn't point back to Earth accurately,'' Doyle said. ``Then, the contact was lost.'' Project officials believe the spacecraft detected an unknown onboard problem and entered a protective ``safing mode'' in which it orients itself toward the sun so its solar array will continue to receive power and find a guide star, said Doyle. From that position, it was programmed to automatically start a routine of locating the sun, then searching for Earth, Wall said. The problem with Magellan comes in the wake of NASA's troubles with the flawed Hubble Space Telescope and with hydrogen fuel leaks that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet. Magellan's formal mission to map the surface of Venus is supposed to start Aug. 29. Contact was lost after Magellan started a two-day test meant to make sure the spaceship's radar can make pictures of Venus and to adjust the radar waves so the pictures are focused, said lab official Ed Sherry. Venus, the second planet from the sun, is covered by thick clouds that prevent optical cameras from seeing its rugged landscape. Magellan's $744 million mission will use radar to penetrate the clouds, then collect the reflected waves to make the best maps and pictures yet of Earth's nearest planetary neighbor. The spacecraft was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months ago and went into orbit around Venus a week ago after a roundabout 948-million-mile journey. At least 20 U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited Venus, including some that landed and photographed a small area of landscape. Magellan will yield a global map. Its radar was designed to distinguish surface features as small as two football fields, a level of detail 10 times better than in pictures made by radar on two Soviet spacecraft that were launched in 1983.", " Air Force officials announced plans Thursday to increase unmanned launches at this coastal base, after reaffirming a decision to put its space shuttle facilities in mothballs. Col. Sebastian Colitore said at the 25th Annual Space Congress convention Thursday in Cocoa Beach, Fla., that the Air Force would build one new launch pad and modify another at the base to launch the Titan 4 missile. His statement came a day after Maj. Gen. Donald Cromer, chief of the Space and Missile Test Organization at Vandenberg, reaffirmed a February announcement that the $3.5 billion shuttle launch facility at Vandenberg was being placed in mothballs because of federal budget cuts. Cromer said the move would save the Air Force $40 million in 1989. The Air Force plans to use the shuttle pad to launch other, unmanned missles, Maj. Sgt. Bruce Zielsdorf, a Vandenberg spokesman, said Thursday. The Titan 4, the military's workhorse missile, carries huge, shuttle-sized payloads and satellites into orbit. The first planned launch of the Titan 4, which is 20 feet taller than the shuttle at 204 feet, is set for February 1990, Colitore said. The Air Force also will modify another launch pad for old Titan 2 intercontinental missiles that are being refurbished into space boosters, said Lt. Col. Mike Callaway, project manager. The first launch of the Titan 2 is set for July 1 at Vandenberg, he said. Colitore said the Air Force would increase its unmanned launches at Vandenberg, 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles on the California coast. The Vandenberg shuttle site has been regularly maintained at a cost of $50 million a year since the space shuttle Challenger exploded during launch in Florida in January 1986, killing the seven people aboard. It was to be the next site of a shuttle launch in July 1986. But after the Challenger disaster, NASA moved the launch back to 1992. Now launches have been indefinitely postponed at Vandenberg, although an August shuttle launch is planned at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Even if Vandenberg's vast shuttle complex, which includes a launch pad, buildings and runway, were to be reactivated, it would take at least four years for it to be functional, Zielsdorf said.", " NASA finished testing the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope aboard Discovery and started final pre-countdown work Thursday, raising the space agency's hopes for a timely launch next week. It is the most comfortable NASA officials have felt about Tuesday's launch date since a power outage interrupted the testing Monday, said George Diller, a spokesman for the space agency. ``Basically, the work's done. We're just down to the things you can't do before now anyway,'' Diller said. ``We're essentially on or near schedule on all of that work. I'm really not aware of anything that's unusually shaky,'' he said. The countdown is scheduled to begin Saturday afternoon. Early forecasts show an 80 percent chance of weather favorable for launch Tuesday, with the weather worsening slightly during the next two days. Functional testing of the telescope and shuttle was completed early Thursday, and the launch pad was cleared of all non-essential personnel for final preparation of the payload and orbiter. Technicians were in the middle of the 52-hour test when a power outage at Kennedy Space Center knocked out air conditioning and forced the shutdown of heat-sensitive computers. Testing resumed Tuesday evening and had to be completed by Thursday morning for the mission to stay on schedule. As soon as the testing ended, technicians began the routine procedure of placing explosive devices on the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, external tank and the orbiter itself to be used in the event of a serious malfunction, said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham. Power was turned off to the telescope and shuttle so that the hazardous work could be performed. Charging of the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries also was halted and was to resume. The telescope's batteries will be charged until the shuttle's payload bay doors are closed two days before launch. The 24,250-pound, 43-foot-long telescope, named for the late American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, is the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but was delayed due to technical problems and the 1986 Challenger explosion. Discovery's five astronauts plan to deploy the telescope on the second day of the five-day mission. The Hubble will orbit 380 miles high for 15 years, enabling astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. It will be capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.", " The Galileo spaceship swooped past Venus early Saturday, and the cloud-shrouded planet acted as a gravity slingshot to help hurl the craft toward its 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter. Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a radio signal confirming that the 2.8-ton spacecraft made its closest approach to Venus at 12:59 a.m. EST, cruising 10,028 miles above the planet's hellishly hot surface. ``We have just flown through our closest approach point to Venus,'' said Bill O'Neil, science and mission design manager. ``The greatest challenge of getting Galileo to Jupiter has been met.'' Four hours before the close encounter, radio signals received on Earth confirmed the spacecraft computer ordered Galileo's infrared light sensor to start observing Venus. The instrument was looking for the glow of the hot lower atmosphere backlighting cooler clouds overhead, O'Neil said. That started an eight-hour period of intensive photography and measurements, including a photographic search for lightning. Earlier Friday, Galileo studied dust particles and magnetic fields in space, and measured Venusian atmospheric temperatures. ``The Venus encounter is our first major milestone in the mission,'' said Galileo project scientist Torrence Johnson. ``After the encounter, we have gained enough energy out of this celestial billiard shot to get the energy we need to make it all the way to Jupiter.'' The power the spacecraft gains in the flyby is triple the energy of its propellant supply, said mission director Neal Ausman. The $1.35 billion mission will let Galileo examine Earth, its moon and one or two asteroids before the spacecraft separates into an orbiter and a small probe in July 1995. In December 1995, they arrive at Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet, after a 2.4-billion-mile trip, including 182 million miles to reach Venus. Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18. Venus circles the sun between the orbits of Earth and Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. Acid-laden clouds extend 40 miles above the surface, trapping heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that raised surface temperatures to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that on Earth. Venus is about 95 percent as wide as Earth. Scientists suspect it may have active volcanoes and shifting plates on its crust. The Venus flyby was designed purely to give Galileo a boost for its trip to Jupiter by increasing its speed from 83,750 mph to 88,740 mph. In two other ``gravity assist'' maneuvers, the spacecraft will use the Earth as a slingshot next Dec. 8 and again on Dec. 8, 1992, so it will be properly aimed toward Jupiter, Ausman said. Scientists decided to take advantage of the Venus encounter by having Galileo's camera and instruments make photographs and measurements of Venus starting Thursday night and continuing for a week. But almost all the pictures and data _ stored on three tracks of Galileo's four-track tape recorder _ won't be sent back to Earth until October, when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the material with its low-gain antenna. That antenna now can be used only for communications to keep Galileo operating. Galileo's main umbrella-shaped antenna must remain furled to protect it from sunlight until after the craft makes its first flight past Earth. Galileo was programmed to photograph Venus and study the planet with its ultraviolet, infrared and visible light sensors to look for lightning, study the makeup of the carbon dioxide atmosphere, examine cloud and wind patterns, map cloudtop temperatures and peer at the lower atmosphere. Sensors that detect particles and magnetic fields were programmed to study how solar wind interacts with Venus' atmosphere. At the same time, NASA arranged for the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, circling Venus since 1978, to make similar measurements closer to the planet, Johnson said. While nearly 20 other U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited Venus, ``we think we're going to get some real good stuff,'' he said. But scientists won't know for months unless engineers meet success next week when they try to have Galileo send back a small amount of data, Johnson added. Studies from Earth and previous spacecraft indicate Venus has continent-sized highlands with peaks dwarfing Mount Everest and hundreds of thousands of volcanoes stretching across lowland plains. NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched from Atlantis last May 4, will go into orbit around Venus in August. It will use radar to peer through the clouds and map at least 70 percent of Venus' surface during a $550 million mission. When the Galileo probe and orbiter reach Jupiter, the probe will parachute into the atmosphere and make measurements until intense heat and pressure vaporize it. The orbiter will photograph and study Jupiter and its major moons until late 1997, circling the planet instead of flying past it like the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration originally planned to send Galileo on a two-year trip to Jupiter by launching it with a Centaur rocket after it was released from a shuttle. But the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew members raised safety concerns. NASA decided against using the volatile, liquid-fueled Centaur. So Galileo was launched with a much weaker Inertial Upper Stage booster after it was deployed by Atlantis' crew. The weaker rocket required NASA to redesign Galileo's route so the craft could utilize gravity from Venus and Earth for a much longer, looping trip to Jupiter. Environmentalists failed in court to stop NASA from having a shuttle carry Galileo into space. They feared a Challenger-like explosion could contaminate Florida with plutonium in Galileo's nuclear batteries, which are not reactors but generate electricity using heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium. NASA said the risk was minimal. Galileo is named for the Italian Renaissance astronomer who discovered Jupiter's major moons.", " A weather satellite that will help the military plan air, sea and ground operatios was launched Saturday into a near-polar orbit, the Air Force said. An Atlas E booster blasted off with a payload for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. The satellite went into orbit about five minutes later about 500 hundred miles above Earth. ``It's going to take 20 days or so to fully check out the satellite and make sure it's working properly,'' said Staff Sgt. Tom Clements. ``From what we can see, everything looks picture perfect.'' Meteorology information gathered by optical scanners on the satellite will be used by all branches of the military to aid commanders planning air, sea and ground operations, the Air Force said. The satellite cost about $40 million to build in 1981, Clements said. By today's dollars, the price tag is closer to $60 million. The Atlas E program costs $30 million to $40 million per year to launch two payloads, he said. The satellite will allow forecasters to track existing and developing weather patterns over remote areas. It will also be used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and similar civilian agencies.", " NASA has agreed to help pick a landing site on Mars for a robot craft that the Soviets will launch in 1994, American and Soviet scientists announced Thursday at a joint news conference. Samuel W. Keller, the head of the NASA delegation that has been negotiating with Soviet scientists, said that the Soviets have picked four candidate landing sites after the United States provided detailed maps of the Martian surface. Keller said the Soviets have now asked for more data and details on the candidate sites. He made the comment at a news conference marking the end of a week of negotiations between representatives of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a delegation representing the Soviet solar system exploration program. The two groups met to work out areas of cooperation. Academician Valeriy L. Barsukov, head of the Soviet delegation, said that the four candidate Mars landing sites are all located within 30 degrees of the equator, but he declined to be more specific. NASA accumulated a vast amount of detailed images and maps of Mars during Viking spacecraft missions between 1975 and 1980. The Viking program put two craft in orbit of Mars and two on the surface. The Soviets plan to launch a spacecraft in 1994 that will orbit Mars and drop a lander that will scoop up soil and return it to Earth. Barsukov said that in picking a landing site the Soviets are considering such issues as a search for water and life, getting comprehensive samples of the geology, and gaining insights into the Martian evolution. Keller said other agreements reached during negotiations this week included: _Using the American Deep Space Network to help track and communicate with Soviet Mars probes. _An exchange of scientific personnel for work on specific missions. _An exchange of data on Venus, a planet extensively explored by both countries. Keller said the U.S.-Soviet studies are being combined to produce four detailed maps. _An exchange of lunar material gathered by the Apollo program for meteorite material collected by the Soviets. _An exchange of scientific instruments for use on planetary probes. Barsukov said that the Soviets feel that a manned Mars landing is ``inevitable'' and that it probably will take place in the middle of the next century. But before a manned mission to Mars is attempted, Barsukov said there probably will be new manned flights to the moon. He declined to elaborate.", " Robby, a $1 million robot rover vehicle designed to explore Mars, successfully picked its way along a rocky dry river bed without human help, NASA said. ``This is the first time that an autonomous vehicle has ever navigated rugged terrain using video cameras,'' said Roger Bedard, planetary rover program manager at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``Robby himself wouldn't go to Mars. He's a test vehicle.'' NASA called the Sept. 13 test ``a significant milestone'' in developing a planet-roving, computer-guided vehicle that would explore Mars to find suitable landing sites for a manned mission to the red planet. It will be about 1995 before engineers fully develop rover technology, and about 2000 before one can be built to go to Mars, Bedard said Wednesday. During the test, Robby took four hours, 20 minutes to crawl along a 109-yard course in the rugged Arroyo Seco, a dry river bed in a canyon next to the laboratory. NASA wants a real Mars rover to travel about 13 miles daily. Bedard said engineers told Robby where it was and where it was supposed to go, but the six-wheeled vehicle used its twin television cameras and computer to navigate a safe course around boulders and other obstacles. Other tests were conducted last week. Robby is about 15 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall. It was named after Robby the Robot in ``Forbidden Planet,'' a 1956 science fiction film. The robot's television cameras give it stereoscopic vision, allowing it a three-dimensional look at objects about 6{ feet in front of it. Robby moves about 6{ feet at a time, then stops to survey another 6{-foot stretch of terrain before proceeding. Robby runs on a battery recharged by an onboard gasoline generator. A Mars rover would be powered by the radioactive decay of plutonium, Bedard said. The only unmanned rovers to explore another planet were two Soviet Lunakod vehicles that explored the moon in the early 1970s, Bedard said. NASA astronauts used a manned vehicle on the moon. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't yet have specific plans to put rovers on Mars, Bedard said. The Soviets are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a 1994 mission to Mars. During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would repeatedly rise and settle on Mars' surface were tested in California's desert by engineers from France, the Soviet Union and the Planetary Society, a group that advocates space exploration. Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian surface at night to take measurements. Bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on prevailing winds.", " Five American airlines have been authorized to open passenger and cargo service to Tokyo and other cities in Japan, the Department of Transportation announced on Monday. Three air carriers - United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines - were authorized to serve Tokyo. Delta, America West Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were authorized to serve two other Japanese cities, Nagoya and Fukuoka. The route awards were granted under a November 1989 agreement which laid the foundation for a major expansion of air service between the United States and Japan. In making the announcement the department noted that the U.S.-Japanese market currently generates more than $6 billion in revenue for both countries. Last year the Japan market ranked third in numbers of passengers, after Canada and Great Britain, and was first in passenger revenue. Monday's announcement is the last of several awards authorizing new flights to Japan. In July, Federal Express, which had been providing all-cargo service to Tokyo, was permitted to serve Nagoya as well. In August, United Cargo Service was selected to operate a new all-cargo service to Tokyo. And in September the department allotted the 450 charter flights authorized by the agreement. Patrick V. Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for international affairs, made the following new selections: -Chicago-Tokyo authority to United with backup authority to American if United does not choose to fly the new route. -Los Angeles-Tokyo authority to Delta with backup authority to American. San Jose-Tokyo authority to American with backup authority to Continental Airlines for Houston-Tokyo service. -Honolulu-Nagoya authority to America West with backup authority to Continental. -Honolulu-Fukuoka authority to Hawaiian Airlines with backup authority to Continental for Los Angeles-Nagoya service. -Portland-Nagoya authority to Delta with backup authority to Continental for Seattle-Nagoya service. Nine air carriers submitted 23 proposals for the new routes, the department said.", " A Japan Airlines order for 20 Boeing 747-400 airplanes is one of the top Boeing orders of all time and makes JAL the largest customer for the jumbo jet, Boeing officials said Thursday. The order, worth $3.1 billion, brings to 40 the number of firm orders placed by JAL for the 747-400s. JAL also has options for 34 more of the aircraft. If all options are exercised, the order would be worth more than $7 billion, said Tom Cole, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. The jet, which can seat 600 people, has a range to 8,400 miles and a computer-aided cockpit that requires a crew of only two. The JAL planes will be configured to carry 375 to 404 passengers in three classes and will be outfitted with General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Following JAL in firm orders for the 747-400s are Singapore Airlines with 29 and All Nippon Airways Co. of Japan with 26, Cole said. ``We call the Pacific a `747 ocean,''' he said. ``We do expect the airplane to sell well. It really has no competition.'' The order brings to 1,002 the total number of orders for the 747 series jets, making it the fourth civil airplane type in history to surpass the 1,000-mark in sales, Boeing said. The other models are Boeing's 727 and 737 series and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series. In dollar terms, the deal puts JAL in a four-way tie for fourth place among all Boeing orders with All Nippon Airways, United Airlines and Delta Airlines. The largest Boeing order ever was made by GPA Ltd. in May 1989, with 182 planes worth $9.4 billion. That order did not include any 747s, Cole said. Boeing has delivered 70 of the 747-400s since the model was first rolled off the assembly line in January 1989. A total of 279 of the jets have now been ordered. The JAL order brings to 138 the number of firm orders for Boeing planes this year, worth $11.4 billion, Cole said. The company sold a record 887 jets worth $46.7 billion last year, he said. Sumitaka Kawamura of JAL said that if the airline exercises all 34 options, its total investment in 747-400s will be nearly $12 billion. JAL plans to increase its fleet from 100 planes to 170 by 1999 to meet an expected increase in passengers. Kawamura said JAL had received five of the 747-400s planes by March, and would receive the rest by 1999 ``if our plans are not changed.'' Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) said the orders would help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States.", " The chairman of Texas Air Corp. Friday defended a decision by the company's subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, to lay off 4,000 employees and cut service as a way to ``stabilize the company'' by cutting losses. Frank Lorenzo, testifying at a federal court hearing on Eastern's plans to eliminate service to 14 cities, said the layoffs and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially troubled carrier. ``If Eastern's management is not permitted to take the actions to save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,'' Lorenzo said, rejecting suggestions by union attorneys that he was trying to bust organized labor at Eastern by transferring the carrier's assets to Continental Airlines, another Texas Air property. Three labor unions that represent Eastern employees have challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order that bars the airline from making layoffs. U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker is holding hearings on the union's bid for a permanent injunction. Lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks ``as an attempt to stabilize the company ... and decrease the losses.'' Eastern currently is in federally supervised contract negotiations with two of its unions, the Association of Air Line Pilots and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Lorenzo denied suggestions that Texas Air planned to merge Eastern's operations into Continental. Union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that Lorenzo was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air had purchased Eastern. The draft said that the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air leverage over the unions. ``Eastern's airplanes can be repainted and moved over to Continental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,'' the speech draft said. But Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking firm. It was unclear from the testimony if Lorenzo ever delivered that portion of the speech.", " Israeli officials today said Jordan's decision to cancel a $1.3 billion development plan for the Israeli-occupied territories would have no practical effect because the plan existed primarily on paper. Palestinian leaders in the West Bank were divided on the impact. Some said it would seriously hurt some residents already struggling financially because of the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands. Jordan announced Thursday it was canceling the development program in a move to hand over more responsibility for the 1.5 million Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli expert on the West Bank, said he thought the move was the first step toward a decision by Jordan's King Hussein eventually to cut ties with the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip altogether. ``He wants to see how people react. But ultimately he has no choice but to cut ties,'' Benvenisti, head of the West Bank Data Bank, a U.S.-funded research project, said in an interview. ``If he doesn't, he gives money to people who in the long run are his enemies,'' said Benvenisti, referring to a growing anti-Jordanian slant among West Bank Palestinians. He said Hussein's plan ``was a bubble. King Hussein didn't have the money for the project. He hoped to get foreign governments to donate funds.'' It is difficult to gauge how much of the $1.3 billion has reached the occupied territories. Deposed Gaza City Mayor Rashad Shawaa said the Gaza Strip had received about $6.6 million. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the Jordanian measure would not affect his approach to a Middle East peace settlement based on Israeli-Jordanian negotiations. Hussein and Peres, of the left-leaning Labor Party, agreed last year to hold direct talks in the framework of an international peace conference. The accord was vetoed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud Bloc. Peres, speaking on Israel radio, said Jordan remained crucial to a resolution of the Palestinian problem because the 850,000 West Bank Palestinians hold Jordanian passports, the West Bank and Jordan have strong trade links, and Israel and Jordan share a long border. In Gaza City, Shawaa, known for his pro-Jordanian views, said in an interview that the move was ``regrettable because people here need help, and this was an important source of help.'' But Mustafa Natsche, deposed mayor of the West Bank city of Hebron and a PLO supporter, said ``the Amman decision will not affect anybody.'' Natsche said the Palestinians in the West Bank needed contributions from all the Arab countries, not just Jordan. But he said what they needed most was to be steadfast in their struggle to end Israeli occupation. The five-year project was set up by Jordan in 1986 under an agreement with Yasser Arafat's PLO. It was to improve health, education, housing, cultural and other services in the territories. Israel took the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Two-thirds of Jordan's 3.5 million people are of Palestinian origin.", " Northwest Airlines is offering flight attendants two free first-class tickets anywhere in the world for reporting as scheduled for holiday duty. It's an attempt to cut down on sick calls over the holidays. In a recent letter to workers, Northwest in-flight services chief Lloyd Warren thanked flight attendants in advance for reporting for holiday duty. And as ``a token of our thanks,'' Warren said, two free round-trip tickets in first-class seating would be given to flight attendants who report as scheduled between Dec. 15 and Jan. 1. Northwest employs more than 8,000 flight attendants. To qualify, workers must be scheduled for flights on Dec. 24, Dec. 25, Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Service charges that normally accompany worker flight-pass privileges would be waived. Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said that last year, flight attendants were offered a $100 cash bonus for working through the holidays. Miller said the offer does not reflect a problem with holiday sick leave in the ranks of flight attendants. ``It's just that when we're in crunch time like we are around the holidays, every single person is key to our success,'' he said.", " Eastern Airlines said Wednesday it has canceled its contract with Orion Air Inc. to provide strike-replacement pilots, but pledged to remain flying in the event of labor troubles. Eastern, preparing for tough negotiations with the Machinists union on its expiring labor pact, had contracted with Orion in case its own pilots refused to cross picket lines, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. But U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker in Washington ruled in March that the deal with Orion violated the existing contract between Eastern and its pilots union. Replacements cannot be trained until a strike begins, the judge said. Orion, based in Raleigh, N.C., is one of the largest U.S. operators of aircraft for the small package industry. Miami-based Eastern, the nation's sixth-largest airline, is a subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp. The Transport Workers Union filed a similar suit in April, accusing Eastern of using its planes to train Orion flight attendants to break a strike. Ms. Ceremsak refused to attribute the cancellation of the Orion contract to Eastern's legal setbacks, however. The contract was terminated ``for sound business reasons,'' said Ms. Ceremsak. ``Beyond that I can't elaborate.'' The decision to end the contract does not mean that financially troubled Eastern will shut down if the Machinists walk out, the spokeswoman said. ``We do have plans to operate in case of a strike,'' she said. ``But our first priority is still reaching a settlement'' with the Machinists. J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for the pilots union at Eastern, said the federal court decisions against Eastern left the carrier with no choice. ``This is just the inevitable recognition that you have to obey court orders,'' said Stokes. ``The judge said you cannot train (replacement) pilots in any capacity until such time as there is a strike.'' The cancellation will cost Eastern about $5.5 million under a provision of the Orion contract, Stokes said. Ms. Ceremsak refused to comment on any provisions of the contract or its cancellation.", " Air France said Friday it has agreed to acquire a controlling interest in the privately held airline Union de Transports Aeriens, in a move that values UTA at almost 7 billion French francs, or around $1.2 billion. Air France, the government-owned airline, said it will buy initially a block of 930,000 UTA shares representing 54.58 percent of UTA's capital from Chargeurs SA, a holding company with transportation and textile interests. Air France said it will pay 4,083 francs, or $714, for each UTA share. Trading in UTA shares was suspended on the Paris Stock Exchange Friday at 2,770 francs, or $484. The Societe des Bourses Francaises, which regulates securities trading, announced the halt amid rumors that Air France would be purchasing a major stake in UTA, France's biggest private airline. Air France said it is offering the same terms to UTA's minority shareholders. Chargeurs controls 82.9 percent of UTA's capital, and Air France will have first refusal rights if Chargeurs decides on any future dilution of its stake in UTA. UTA has a fleet of only 19 jets, six of which are owned by its charter subsidiary Aeromaritime. UTA operates on long-haul routes, mainly to the Pacific and Africa. Chargeurs Chairman Jerome Seydoux had said on several occasions that he would sell UTA if the French government did not authorize it to operate on European and transatlantic routes. In late 1988, the French government rejected UTA's request for new routes and said it was opposed to allowing UTA to fly to Newark, N.J., although two years ago UTA won the right to operate between Paris and San Francisco. Air France said the takeover will create an air transport group that will be able to compete on an even footing with big international competitors. Several of Air France's European rivals, notably British Airways PLC and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, have considered or made investments in foreign airlines as a way to position themselves to exploit the Common Market deregulation set to begin in 1992. The deal also gives Air France control of the French domestic airline Air Inter. UTA holds 35.8 percent of Air Inter stock and Air France has 37 percent. Transport Minister Michel Delebarre issued a statement praising the deal. But the takeover could spark a political debate, because Socialist President Francois Mitterrand had promised there would be neither nationalizations nor privatizations during his current 7-year term. As part of the deal, UTA will acquire the 49 percent minority stake in Aeromaritime that is held by Chargeurs, giving UTA full control of the charter operation. Financial analysts said Air France's purchase of 54.6 percent of UTA will give Chargeurs an immediate cash injection of almost 3.8 billion francs, or $665 million. Chargeurs' 1989 earnings were affected by a strike by UTA pilots that lasted several months.", " Pan American World Airways called on the United States and foreign governments today to establish uniform anti-terrorist security measures for all air carriers. In a full-page advertisement carried in The New York Times and the Washington Post, Pan Am said security measures ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration were required for American airlines, but not for foreign carriers. ``To be effective, security systems must come about through a cooperative team effort among governments, their agencies and airlines,'' it said. ``To do otherwise would be to perpetuate the present patchwork of rules and regulations.'' The advertisement, signed by Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett, came one day after the President's Commission on Aviation and Security and Terrorism released a critical report on airline security. The commission was convened to investigate the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 259 people on the plane and 11 people on the ground. Pan Am suggested that security systems could be supported by government funds or a surcharge on all international air fares. ``Governments of all nations must take direct responsibility ... by providing whatever resources are necessary for improving the security of international air travel,'' the airline said. The presidential commission's report called on the government to consider ``preemptive or retaliatory military strikes'' against terrorist enclaves in other countries to combat air terrorism. A system should be set up to notify passengers of credible terrorist threats, it said, and the government should take more seriously the possibility of terrorist strikes in the United States.", " Parliament's Finance Committee said Tuesday it approved spending $20.5 million to improve Jewish settlements in the occupied territories at the request of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. The decision came Monday after a plea from Shamir, who asked the committee in a letter to allocate the funds to the Housing Ministry. A copy of Shamir's letter was obtained by The Associated Press. Shamir asked that the money be used to develop settlements and roads beyond the Green Line, which divides Israel from the territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East War. A Shamir spokesman insisted the money would be used only to improve existing settlements, not build new ones. Two new settlements established by Shamir's caretaker government have sparked protests from the United States, which says settlements in the occupied areas are an obstacle to peacemaking. Shulamit Aloni, a Finance Committee member and left-wing legislator, condemned the decision to allocate the money. ``This decision was passed by a completely insane system at a time of political unrest,'' Aloni said. He said it could hurt U.S. aid to Israel and endanger Soviet Jewish emigration. Thousands of Soviet Jews are expected to immigrate to Israel this year, and there is concern in the Soviet Union and among Arab countries that some could settle in the occupied lands. Israel denies it has a policy of steering immigrants to the occupied territories. A report by an Israeli diplomat in Washington released Tuesday in the daily Haaretz supported Aloni's claims. Yoram Ettinger, aide to deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Natanyahu, said the U.S. Congress appeared to be less motivated to maintain strategic cooperation with Israel and more inclined to support Palestinians in their struggle for statehood, Haaretz reported. The Arab states see any settlement move as an attempt to push out Palestinians from the occupied territories. Government officials insisted that the money approved by the Finance Committee would not be used to form a new Jewish presence in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. ``We are talking about already existing settlements, not forming new ones,'' Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner said. The allocated money included $2.5 million to ``strengthen'' new settlements and $3 million for developing and expanding existing settlements. A separate sum of $2.5 million was allocated to purchase prefabricated houses and strengthen settlements in the West Bank. Ariel Weinstein, who represents Shamir's Likud bloc on the Finance Committee, said the government decided on a policy of settling the occupied territories and they should be treated as any other Israeli town. ``They need new roads, schools. Nobody thinks the government can decide not to fulfill these needs,'' Weinstein said. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak warned Tuesday that settlement of Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israeli-occupied lands threatens ``new bloody confrontation'' in the Middle East. He spoke at the opening session of Socialist International, a non-governmental grouping of 89 socialist parties from 47 countries.", " Union pilots who struck Eastern Airlines are entitled to replace trainees hired to help the carrier rebuild, a federal judge said. Thursday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis apparently affects only those who were in training when time the pilots ended their walkout, said E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. Still, Breen said, ``It's clearly a major victory.'' All but 200 of the 3,600 union pilots walked off the job in sympathy with Machinists who struck the Miami-based airline in March 1989. Pilots ended their sympathy walkout in November, but fewer than 50 have been called back to Eastern, pilots association officials say. The Machinists are still striking. At least 404 pilots were in training when the pilots returned to work, the pilots association says. The airline estimates only 180 jobs are affected by the ruling, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. Further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of affected jobs, Breen said. Eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision. The airline predicted the ruling wouldn't immediately affect current employees or operations. Many pilots took jobs with other airlines after the strike began March 4, 1989, but about 1,400 former Eastern pilots may still be interested in returning, pilots' association spokesman Lou Baldwin said. Davis' ruling stems from the association's challenge of Eastern's claim that the formerly striking pilots were not needed. Davis agreed that the federal Railway Labor Act guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees. Davis said Eastern violated the Railway Labor Act by hiring pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights. The act was devised to provide ``uninterrupted transportation service,'' the ruling said. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike began. It presently operates about 800 flights, down from its pre-strike service of 1,040. Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis' ruling must receive bankruptcy court approval. If the ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning pilots would need to go through several weeks of recertification training under the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said. Eastern currently has about 1,900 pilots, including those trained before the strike was settled, pilots hired from other airlines and union pilots who later crossed picket lines. Baldwin said the Eastern pilots trainees' annual pay is about $27,000. The average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited pilots was about $65,000, he said.", " At an unusual prayer breakfast, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha urged three black African leaders Wednesday to ``join hands'' in regional cooperation. Botha, who represented President F. W. de Klerk, addressed the heads of state as ``my African brothers'' during the informal meeting, which was punctuated by joking and laughter. The breakfast host was Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, head of the seven-nation Frontline States, a regional bloc that once led efforts to end apartheid in South Africa. The other two leaders were President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who maintains close contacts with South Africa, and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, the current chairman of the 51-member Organization of African unity. President Bush sent a congratulatory message, saying the meeting ``marks a new era in Africa.'' The get-together over eggs, bacon and croissants signaled a further easing of tensions between white-led South Africa and its anti-apartheid neighbors. Zambian officials said it was made possible by de Klerk's recent steps toward dismantling apartheid, including legalizing the African National Congress, freeing political prisoners including the ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and lifting the state of emergency in black townships. The ANC, outlawed for 30 years in South Africa, had its headquarters in the Zambian capital of Lusaka until early this year. Kaunda, once one of the most vocal African critics of apartheid, said the theme of the meeting was ``peace, unity and reconciliation.'' Botha told the black African leaders that South Africa could help economic development in the largely impoverished region, adding: ``We in Africa must join hands and move closer together.'' ``South Africa must play its rightful role in southern Africa and we are ready to play that role,'' Botha said. Ugandan President Museveni said he got the idea for such a meeting from a prayer breakfast he attended with U.S. congressmen two years ago. He wanted to organize something similar, he said, but as he was not a good Christian he asked Kaunda to be host. Three other African heads of state, Quett Masire of Botswana, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi and Metsing Lekhanya of Lesotho, were invited but did not attend.", " The African National Congress recommended Monday that Nelson Mandela meet rival black leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a breakthrough that could help ease the violence in black townships. The ANC proposed a meeting between itself and Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha Freedom Party ``in the near future,'' but did not specify a date. The ANC statement said both Mandela and Buthelezi should attend. Buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and was ready to consider a suitable time and place for the talks. Mandela is in Australia and will be traveling throughout Asia until early November. Since his release from prison in February, Mandela has turned down invitations from his old friend Buthelezi despite the ongoing violence between their supporters in the eastern province of Natal and in black areas outside Johannesburg. ANC leaders have harshly briticized Buthelezi and accused him of orchestrating the violence to obtain a meeting with Mandela and enhance his stature. Buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the ANC of trying to destroy all rivals. The ANC was conciliatory in its statement Monday. The group said ``it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party'' to stop the violence. The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks, but neither Mandela nor Buthelezi has attended. About 5,000 blacks have died in the ANC-Inkatha power struggle since 1986 in Natal Province. The fighting spread to the Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives. The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black opposition movements, both oppose apartheid but differ over tactics and a future South Africa. The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes, protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its battle against the government. Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors capitalism. The ANC draws support across tribal lines, while virtually all Inkatha members are Zulus. The ANC also has opposed Buthelezi's role as leader of the KwaZulu homeland in Natal Province. The ANC considers the 10 black homelands part of the apartheid system. Buthelezi, meanwhile, sees the limited self-government in the homelands as an interim step on the road to black majority rule.", " The family of jailed black activist Nelson Mandela on Friday requested the government to release his medical records to determine whether prison conditions may have contributed to his contracting tuberculosis. The 70-year-old Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress, was transferred a week ago from the Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town to nearby Tygerberg Hospital. Reports of his illness triggered a wave of new appeals at home and abroad for his release after 26 years in jail. A statement issued on behalf of the Mandela family by anti-apartheid activists said Mandela was receiving good care at Tygerberg. But it questioned whether conditions at Pollsmoor may have contributed to the disease or whether doctors there could have made a quicker diagnosis. Doctors have said the prognosis for Mandela's recovery is good and treatment is expected to take about five months. The statement asked that Mandela's medical records be released to his family ``to dispel the nagging doubts existing in their minds.'' It was signed by the Rev. Beyers Naude, a white anti-apartheid activist on behalf of a new group called the Mandela Crisis Committee. Mandela's illness presents South African President P.W. Botha with one of the toughest dilemmas of his 10 years in power. The president, who has faced rising pressure to free Mandela, knows that violence could break out if the leader dies in jail. But he also knows that releasing the leader of the biggest guerrilla group fighting white rule would anger the right wing and could trigger renewed black activism as nationwide municipal elections approach on Oct. 26. On Thursday, Botha said Mandela's release was under serious consideration and indicated the government was trying to Mandela to accept its condition that he renounce violence. Mandela, jailed since 1962, is serving a life sentence for plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow the government and its apartheid system of racial segregation. Neither the ANC nor Mandela's family have issued a formal response to Botha's remarks. But the statement issued by the activists Friday said Mandela ``has made his position very clear regarding the issue of violence.'' Mandela rejected a previous offer of conditional release, saying he would not renounce violence until the government legalized the ANC, dismantled apartheid and opened negotiations aimed at granting full political rights to the black majority. The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg daily, quoted unidentified government sources as saying there was no possibility of Mandela's release before the October elections, which will mark the first time that blacks and whites across the country vote on the same day. The government depicts the event as a major step toward democracy and has outlawed calls for an election boycott. But anti-apartheid groups have made clear they reject the election as an attempt to entrench a segregated political system. South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

Botha apologized on behalf of the government Tuesday for a police search of the West German consul's home, but also criticized West Germany's policies. Police searched the home of Erhard Loeser, West Germany's acting consul-general, on Monday. They were looking for Heinrich Grosskopf, a 24-year-old white South African accused of a car-bombing last week that killed three people. Officials claim Grosskopf carried out that bombing and at least one other on orders from the outlawed African National Congress, the predominantly black guerrilla group fighting to end domination by South Africa's white minority. Botha gave no reason why police decided to search Loeser's home and coupled his apology with an attack on Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany for suggesting a boycott of South African products as a means of protesting the apartheid racial policy. He said the suggestion was ``callously irresponsible'' and a boycott would ``deprive people of their livelihood.'' The foreign minister also criticized Genscher for questioning the fairness of legal proceedings for the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks granted a one-month stay of execution last week. They were convicted of complicity in the mob killing of a black official. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.", " Senators of both parties on Saturday hailed the plan to free black leader Nelson Mandela from a South African prison and called on both sides in that strife-torn nation to begin meaningful negotiations. ``It's the right move,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said. ``Now comes the real test for South Africa _ will there be peace as meaningful negotiations move forward? Let's hope so.'' The comment came in a statement released by Dole's office after South African President F.W. de Klerk announced that the African National Congress leader would be freed Sunday after 27 years. De Klerk also said the state of emergency under which freedoms have been suspended in South Africa could be lifted within weeks if conditions of stability prevail across the country following Mandela's release. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chief Senate sponsor of legislation to impose sanctions on South Africa, said in a statement that ``freedom for Nelson Mandela means that freedom is closer for all the people of South Africa.'' ``His unjust imprisonment has long been the symbol of the cruelty and injustice of the racist system of apartheid.'' Kennedy said. He expressed hope that ``today's historic development marks the beginning of a genuine commitment by President de Klerk and his government to dismantle all aspects of apartheid as soon as possible.'' Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said in a telephone interview that the release of Mandela along with de Klerk's other remarks were ``welcome and significant.'' ``It is significant because without this there could be no real negotiations and when you couple this with President de Klerk's statement that within a few weeks he's going to completely lift the state of emergency, you have the conditions for a successful resolution of all this,'' he said. Sanctions against South Africa imposed by the United States and European countries were credited in large part for the change in course on the part of the South African government. The U.S. sanctions, imposed in 1986, barred new American investment in South Africa, including bank loans to the government; prohibited the import of South African iron, steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products, including sugar; prevented the United States from exporting computers to South Africa; banned all nuclear trade; and halted landings by South African Airways. The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., said that the United States ``should continue to use the moral and economic lever of even more stringent sanctions as a vehicle for helping to accelerate and expedite the end of apartheid in a nonviolent context.'' ``While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost three decades of imprisonment for his political beliefs, I am concerned that no mention has been made about the release of more than 2,000 other black South Africans still in prison because of their struggle to end apartheid,'' Dellums said. Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., who recently traveled to South Africa, issued a statement calling the release of Mandela ``a major step forward for President de Klerk'' and ``one indication that the winds of democracy that have swept across Europe may be reaching South Africa.'' ``However, before sanctions are relaxed or eliminated, several additional steps must be taken,'' she said. ``These include release of the many remaining political prisoners, lifting of the state of emergency and removal of troops from the townships.'' New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said Mandela ``could have been released a long time ago if he had compromised his principles.'' ``He is an inspiration to all those seeking freedom who will not compromise and I look forward to his unconditional release and the day all South Africans will be free,'' Dinkins said. ``Just because we freed one man doesn't mean we freed an entire nation,'' said Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., the House majority whip and author of legislation imposing U.S. sanctions against South Africa. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said Mandela's release marked ``a significant step'' toward peaceful political change in the country. However, Lewis, a former activist in the U.S. civil rights movement, also urged political leaders here to ``continue to apply pressure on the South Africa government in the form of economic sanctions.'' Randall Robinson, leader of the Washington-based anti-apartheid group TransAfrica, said pressure from the United States and Europe produced the release of Mandela. He described it as a ``tiny step.'' ``Political prisoners must still be released, parliament must repeal apartheid laws and until these things are done it is too early to evaluate the good faith of President de Klerk,'' he said. ``This is only the release of one great man,'' he said. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. and a leading conservative, was not planning a comment on the development, an aide said. Dole was the only Republican with a comment despite calls to spokesmen for several prominent GOP members of Congress.", " African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela accused the South African government Tuesday of massacring demonstrators and causing black-on-black violence. Mandela also charged the government with defaming his wife, Winnie, in a murder and assault trial involving one of her former bodyguards, and said the ANC is not satisfied with reforms introduced by President F.W. de Klerk. Mandela, speaking to reporters after returning from an eight-nation African tour, said de Klerk has no control over the police force. He accused police of ``slaughtering'' black people involved in political demonstrations. He alleged it was government policy to keep ANC supporters fighting members of the Inkatha political organization in Natal province, where more than 5,000 people have died in the past five years. ``It is quite clear that the government does not want this violence to end,'' Mandela said. ``If the government continues to massacre our people while they are talking of negotiations, that we cannot permit. We will have to address that question specifically in relation to whether these negotiations shall continue.'' De Klerk is hoping to begin formal talks with black leaders on constitutional changes that would give the black majority a voice in national affairs _ something denied them under the current system of apartheid. Since taking office in August, de Klerk has made a number of reforms, including legalizing the long-banned ANC; freeing Mandela from a life prison term; and ending segregation of beaches and hospitals. Mandela said the ANC is not satisfied. ``We have got basic demands,'' he said. ``The most basic of these is the demand for everybody to have the right to determine his own affairs.'' Mandela said the government has deliberately besmirched his wife's name by linking her to the alleged crimes of one of her former bodyguards, Jerry Richardson, but not charging her. Richardson is charged with murder, kidnapping, attempted murder and assault. Eight other bodyguards are facing lesser charges in separate trials. Three men have testified in court that Winnie Mandela whipped them, beat them allowed her bodyguards to keep them captive in her home and assault them in December 1988 and January 1989. One of the alleged victims, 14-year-old black activist Stompie Seipei Moeketsi, was found dead Jan. 6, 1989. Mrs. Mandela denies wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. ``When my wife is not charged and the whole case centers on her, she has no way of defending herself,'' Mandela said. But Mandela said he was not calling on the government to prosecute his wife. ``I am saying that the way the case has been conducted is intended to defame my wife without her having the opportunity to defend herself,'' he said. It was the first time Mandela had spoken publicly on the matter in South Africa since he was freed Feb. 12 from a life prison term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the white-minority government.", " Consolidated Gold Fields PLC and Newmont Mining Corp. said they filed a federal suit Tuesday to block a $3.5 billion hostile buyout bid by a South African conglomerate, on grounds the offer violates federal securities and antitrust laws. The U.S. District Court suit was the latest action the companies have taken to thwart the overture by South African-controlled Minorco SA, which has offered $3.5 billion for the 70.6 percent of Consolidated Gold Fields it does not already own. London-based Gold Fields owns a 49.3 percent stake in Newmont. Gold Fields and New York-based Newmont last week asked President Reagan to block the takeover on national security grounds, contending a buyout would endanger U.S. access to strategic metals such as gold, platinum and zirconium. Gold Fields has asked the British government to review the bid because of the South African connection, and the South African government also is investigating the proposed acquisition. Named as defendants in the suit filed Tuesday were Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd., De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and Minorco. Luxembourg-based Minorco, which owns 29.4 percent of Gold Fields, is controlled by Anglo American and De Beers Consolidated Mines, the gold and diamond mining interests of the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa. Anglo American and De Beers have said they would relinquish control of Minorco if the bid succeeds. Minorco has said it plans to sell Gold Fields' South African interests and Gold Fields' stake in Newmont if it acquires the company. The Gold Fields-Newmont suit contended the defendants had conspired to monopolize the gold market and that a successful acquisition likely would substantially lessen competition in that market. Gold Fields controls 8 percent of the world's gold production. It also produces rutile and zircon, which are raw materials for metals used in military aircraft and submarines. The suit claimed a takeover of Gold Fields by Minorco would give the South African syndicate control over a third of the world's gold market. The suit stated the Oppenheimer syndicate has major investments in companies that control more than 20 percent of the West's gold production, has interests controlling more than 50 percent of the free world's platinum production and has what it claimed the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation consider ``an absolute monopoly'' over the diamond business.", " South Africa released seven black nationalists from prison today, including the nephew of African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu. The releases raised to 42 the number of political prisoners freed from Robben Island prison since the end of an 11-day hunger strike there in early March. The strike ended after a meeting between lawyers of the 346 hunger strikers and government officials. The details of their agreement have never been made public, but the pace of releases has increased since the meeting. The ANC, the leading black anti-apartheid group, has demanded the release of all prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes as a condition for its participation in formal negotiations on a new constitution. The prisoners freed today included five members of the ANC and two members of the Black Consciousness Movement. Among the prisoners released was Jomguzi Sisulu, 31, who was sentenced in May 1986 to five years for treason. The father of two small children said he was shocked when authorities told him Thursday he would be freed the next day. ``I couldn't believe it, it was so unexpected,'' he said. Sisulu's uncle, Walter, was freed from the same prison in October after serving 25 years of a life term for plotting sabotage to end white rule. President F.W. de Klerk will hold talks April 11 with top ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to work out a framework for constitutional talks.", " African guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma is asking presidential hopefuls Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson to pressure South Africa into relinquishing control over South-West Africa, the territory known as Namibia. Nujoma, who heads the South-West Africa People's Organization, said he had met with campaign managers who promised him a meeting with the two Democratic candidates within the coming week. GOP contender George Bush has not responded to a similar request for a meeting, Nujoma said in an interview Tuesday. Nujoma, 58, said that despite claims to the contrary, South Africa is trying to strengthen its hold over the mineral-rich territory which it rules in defiance of a 1978 U.N. resolution calling for Namibian independence. Nujoma, who lives in exile in Angola, accused South African troops of arson and bombing attacks against Namibia's 1.5 million residents, including the burning of 14 church-run schools last month. South Africa has denied the charges, accusing SWAPO of the attacks. South African President P.W. Botha paid a rare visit to the territory on April 8, and proposed increased powers for his chief representative there. The proposal would weaken the ``transitional'' government established by South Africa in 1985 with a view to eventual independence for Namibia. ``South Africa has no intention whatsoever to leave Namibia,'' said Nujoma. The South Africans will have to be ``forced out by the combined resistance of the Namibian people and international pressure.'' He called on the next U.S. administration to pursue steps similar to the trade sanctions legislated by Congress in 1986 against South Africa. Nujoma said he had requested a meeting with Secretary of State George P. Shultz but had not received any response. A State Department official confirmed Nujoma had asked for a meeting, and said Shultz had yet to reply. Shultz has been criticized by conservative members of Congress, such as Rep. Patrick Swindall, R-Ga., for allowing Nujoma into the country in view of his organization's guerrilla activities and support from the Soviet Union. In a letter to Shultz, Swindall called Nujoma a ``terrorist and Soviet puppet.'' The United States supports a South African pullout and an independent Namibia, but its contacts with SWAPO have been limited. U.S. representatives are taking part in two days of talks in London with representatives from Angola, Cuba and South Africa on a plan for the pullout of South African forces from Namibia and Cuban troops from Angola. Cuba has an estimated 37,000 soldiers in Angola. Estimates for the South African military presence in Namibia range from 40,000 to 100,000. Nujoma said he was sure Angola would protect his group's interests at the talks and press its demands for Namibian independence. ``It will be a package, I am assured of this by the Angolan government,'' he said. If an agreement is worked out, SWAPO will stop its attacks against South African troops, he said. SWAPO says it killed more than 90 South Africans this year, but its claims cannot be verified. Nujoma conceded that SWAPO gets most of its arms and training from the Soviet Union, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Angola and several other members of the Organization of African Unity. But he added that if the United States wants to supply SWAPO with weapons, ``we will certainly accept it with great pleasure.'' Nujoma is on a three-week visit to the United States to attend several U.N.-sponsored seminars on Namibia and to highlight his organization's demands." ]
