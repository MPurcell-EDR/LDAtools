Description: This package implements a collapsed Gibbs Sampler algorithm to fit
    a topic model to a set of unstructured text documents. It contains three basic groups of
    functions: (1) pre-processing of unstructured text, including
    substitutions, tokenization, and stemming, (2) fitting the Latent Dirichlet
    Allocation (LDA) topic model to training data and making model-based
    predictions on test data, and (3) visualizing and summarizing the fitted
    model.
